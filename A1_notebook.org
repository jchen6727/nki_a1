*** 7. Copy .tcshrc file from /u/billl/adm/skel (or /u/ericag) into my local home dir 
**** NOT copying .emacs for now (wiki also states that .emacs can be copied from same location as .tcshrc); using unmodified version on local machine
***** *QUESTION*: what will .emacs do to emacs on my local machine? 
****** conversation with @billl:
******* ericaygriffith: bill I have a question -- I mentioned that I got a new linux system. I'm setting it up to mirror neurosim and install everything per the wiki. I'm wondering now what the .emacs file will do to my emacs if I copy that over from neurosim. I'm going through the dot file now, but figured I would ask you what the major points are. do you recommend I import that dot file to my local machine, or just continue using emacs unmodified for now? 
******* billl: you can try with the .emacs and then if that gets too frustrating drop back to unmodified
******* billl: my .emacs 
******* He then sent a .emacs file which is the same as the one I have (currently in ~/Downloads)
******* billl: if you take the one i have above can search for billl and replace -- only main one is (setenv "PYTHONSTARTUP" "/u/billl/adm/pythonrc")

Libraries have been installed in:
   /home/ricky/neuron/iv/x86_64/lib

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the '-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the '-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to '/etc/ld.so.conf'

Libraries have been installed in:
   /usr/site/../arch/nrn/x86_64/lib

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the '-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the '-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to '/etc/ld.so.conf'

   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable

**** [python_folder] --> "wherever anaconda or whatever python package you are using is"
***** Does this mean I should install anaconda? 
***** Tried to install anaconda2, but bash .sh wouldn't run. 
***** Tried to follow advice on stackoverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43388956/executing-bash-shell-from-cshell-tcsh), but again got the following error:

***** Now, however, I am seeing that the .sh files are empty when I download them from the site. Realizing I may need to wait for it to finish -- MB size keeps increasing. 
****** Download has now stalled at 337.2 MB 
***** Now I will have /usr/site/nrniv/local/python/anaconda3 but I also don't know if that means it is 'installed' -- I suspect not? But at least I will no longer have that message popping up when I open a new terminal?

* <2019-01-16 Wed -- Python install>
** *GOAL*: Fix PATH & PYTHONPATH so that nrniv, nrniv -python work, and anaconda is default python (least important) 
*** *(MISC) BRAINSTORMING*
**** A thought I had -- the first 'error' message I got when opening the terminal, several days ago, was about conda.csh not existing. 
~/usr/site/nrniv/local/python/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.csh: No such file or directory.~
***** What was causing this to try to load this conda.csh file, before I scp'ed anaconda3 from neurosim? Find this out, and may help understand what is going on. 
***** Could it also have to do with NSUF? 
**** Again, the three files in question are:
***** ~/.tcshrc
***** /usr/site/config/csh_defaults
***** /usr/site/nrniv/simctrl/nrnenv.csh

*** *NOTE* anaconda is not default python on laptop 

** Compare PATH & PYTHONPATH to laptop:
*** *NOTE* on laptop, everything specified in .tcshrc file
*** *NOTE* This is before any changes  
*** PYTHONPATH 
**** PYTHONPATH on laptop:
/Applications/NEURON-7.5/nrn/lib/python
**** PYTHONPATH on desktop:
?? See above for various iterations 
*** PATH
**** PATH on desktop:
/usr/site/openmpi-install/bin/
/usr/local/bin
/usr/site/../arch/nrn/x86_64/bin
/usr/site/nrniv/iv/x86_64/bin     (*NOTE: DOES NOT EXIST*)

** Deletion-type CHANGES (i.e. get back to baseline):
*** mv /usr/site/nrniv/local/python/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.csh ..
**** close all terminals and reopen to see if the error message from before reappears 
**** IT DOES NOT 
**** Keep this as it is for now, move back later if everything works again
**** moved conda.sh as well, to parent dir, no sign of the message reappearing
*** comment out PYTHONPATH  in /usr/site/nrniv/simctrl/nrnenv.csh AND ~/.tcshrc
**** commented out 1 line in ~/.tcshrc (regular block)
**** commented out 1 line in regular block of nrnenv.csh AND the entire if-else block below it. 
**** DIFFERENCE (*NOTE -- This is with NO CHANGES TO $PATH!*):
***** Now, when doing nrniv on the command line, instead of a long block of text I get: 
Could not load either libnrnpython3 or libnrnpython2
pyver10=0 pylib=/usr/lib/python3.6/config-3.6m-x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.6m.so
***** and nrniv -python gives the same as above plus
Python not available. 
*** comment out PATH 
**** ~/.tcshrc --> commented out lines:
setenv PATH /home/ricky/anaconda2/bin:${PATH}
set path = ($origpath ...)   *under text input section*
**** /usr/site/config/csh_defaults:
commented out entire initial if-else block
commented out setenv PATH $SITE/openmpi-install/bin:$PATH  *in Open-MPI paths*
**** /usr/site/nrniv/simctrl/nrnenv.csh, commented out:
1x in set path under "Neuron specific variables"
1x in 2nd to last if-else block, in 1st 'if'
1x in same if-else block, in 2nd 'else', 2nd time of set path (1st was already commented out) 
**** ~/.bashrc, commented out:
export PATH=/home/ricky/anaconda2/bin:$PATH
entire conda block at the bottom 

** CHANGE PATH & PYTHONPATH TO BE EQUIVALENT TO LAPTOP:
*** STARTING FROM NO PYTHONPATH on desktop
*** STARTING FROM PATH (on desktop):
/usr/local/sbin
/usr/local/bin
/usr/sbin
/usr/bin
/sbin
/bin
/usr/games
/usr/local/games
/snap/bin
*** *NOTE* python default is no longer anaconda, and nrniv is command not found 
*** Changes to PYTHONPATH on desktop:
**** The equivalent to laptop PYTHONPATH may be: =/home/ricky/neuron/nrn/share/lib/python= 
**** Changed ~/.tcshrc to include setenv PYTHONPATH /home/ricky/neuron/nrn/share/lib/python
**** With PATH as stated above, nrniv is still command not found, etc. (same as *NOTE* above)  
**** CHANGE #2: equivalent may in fact be /usr/site/../arch/nrn/lib/python
**** CHANGE #3: in ~/.tcshrc, modifying PYTHONPATH so it also includes:
setenv PYTHONPATH /usr/site/../arch/nrn/lib/python:/usr/site/../arch/nrn/share/nrn/lib/python
***** Commented out the above change
***** Below it, wrote =setenv PYTHONPATH /usr/site/../arch/nrn/lib/python=
*** Changes to PATH on desktop: 
**** Comparing to PATH on laptop, may need the following:
***** /usr/site/nrniv/local/bin  (*recall difference btwn linux & os x with /usr/local*)
****** I think nrnivmodl should be in here? 
****** But I do have mkmod!
***** [neuron_folder]/x86_64/bin ??????? --> /usr/site/../arch/nrn/x86_64/bin 
****** /home/ricky/neuron/nrn/ does not have these subdirs 
****** Look to list of dirs in original desktop PATH above to see if there are equivalents
******* /usr/site/../arch/nrn/x86_64/bin --> has nrniv! 
******* Set PATH to include this in ~/.tcshrc 
******* Where did it ORIGINALLY come from?  --> potentially /usr/site/nrniv/simctrl/nrnenv.csh
***** [DONE] /usr/local/bin
***** [DONE] /usr/bin
***** [DONE] /bin
***** [DONE] /usr/sbin
***** [?] /usr/local/sbin, /usr/games, /usr/local/games, /snap/bin (*on desktop but not laptop*)

** OTHER CHANGES:
COMMENTING OUT NEURONHOME in .tcshrc, along with 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH
HOC_LIBRARY_PATH

** At the end of the day, default python is python2.7, can't do nrniv or nrniv -python, but does recognize the command. Give it a rest for tonight. 

* <2019-01-17 Thu -- Python install (final)>
** [DONE] Fixing PATH & PYTHONPATH so nrniv and nrniv -python will work
*** Starting PATH & PYTHONPATH
**** PATH
/usr/site/../arch/nrn/x86_64/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
**** PYTHONPATH
/usr/site/../arch/nrn/lib/python:/usr/site/../arch/nrn/share/nrn/lib/python
***** This is according to both appendix F and the section after the cloning (installing NEURON)

*** PATH edits:
**** adding to ~/.tcshrc:
***** =setenv PATH ..... :/home/ricky/anaconda2/bin:${PATH}= --> according to Appendix F  
***** now, default python is anaconda2 

*** PYTHONPATH edits: 
**** adding to ~/.tcshrc:
***** =setenv PYTHONPATH .....:/home/ricky/neuron/nrn/share/lib/python= 

*** Re-do this installation with neuron not in ~/neuron/nrn, but instead in /usr
**** [DONE] That would require unsetting the PATH & PYTHONPATH in ~/.tcshrc for now 
**** Using wiki (instructions for installing Neurosim NEURON), but in the NEURON & Python2.7 installation in the HPC ('ma') section
**** First, install anaconda 
***** should I get rid of anaconda2 in ~/anaconda2? [yes - do this for now w/ rm -r ~/anaconda2]
***** mv Anaconda2..... /usr/site/nrniv/Anaconda2.....
***** cd /usr/site/nrniv
***** bash Anaconda2etc.sh (answered 'yes' to prompt, and set install location to /usr/site/nrniv/anaconda2)
***** said 'yes' to initializing anaconda2 in .bashrc 
****** check bashrc for difference: yes, there is stuff at the end there 
***** close terminals & re-open 
***** echo $PATH and $PYTHONPATH remain as expected -- no PYTHONPATH yet and PATH is only defaults 
***** in ~/.tcshrc, added =setenv PATH /usr/site/nrniv/anaconda2/bin:${PATH}=
***** echo $PATH now includes the above directory 
***** which python --> /usr/site/nrniv/anaconda2/bin/python
***** python --version --> Python 2.7.15 :: Anaconda, Inc.
***** moved back anaconda.sh file to ~/Downloads
**** Next, setup for InterViews & NEURON installation:
***** Removed neuron from ~/neuron --> =rm -r ~/neuron=
***** cd /usr/site/nrniv
***** *DO NOT EXIST?* hg clone /nrn and /iv from repos as specified in wiki 
***** *WILL THIS SCREW ANYTHING UP?* git clone https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn (& iv directory), as specified in Compiling & Installing Neuron using Neurosim paths 
***** setenv NRDIR /usr/site
***** setenv NSRC $NRDIR/nrniv/nrn
***** setenv IVB $NRDIR/nrniv/iv
***** setenv NB $NRDIR/nrniv/nrn/x86_64 --> *NOTE* there is no last slash in wiki... assuming there has to be one there, so adding it in? nrnx86_64 doesn't make much sense???
***** setenv ND $NRDIR/../arch/nrn

**** Install Interviews

Libraries have been installed in:
   /usr/site/nrniv/iv/x86_64/lib

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the '-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the '-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to '/etc/ld.so.conf'

See any operating system documentation about shared libraries for
more information, such as the ld(1) and ld.so(8) manual pages.

Libraries have been installed in:
   /usr/site/../arch/nrn/x86_64/lib

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the '-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the '-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to '/etc/ld.so.conf'

Libraries have been installed in:
   /usr/site/../arch/nrn/x86_64/lib

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the '-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the '-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to '/etc/ld.so.conf'

See any operating system documentation about shared libraries for
more information, such as the ld(1) and ld.so(8) manual pages.

*** (0) What to do w/ the directories that already exist? -- Nothing for now? 
**** (a) the ones w/ corresponding repos on laptop & NEUROSIM
**** (b) the ones w/out corresponding repos, and only directories on laptop  
*** (1) Now that I have cell classification data, organize the data files on laptop according to these categories 
*** (2) Extract the properties of several from each category 
**** First determine what properties are relevant
**** Then determine how to extract -- matlab?
**** Average the properties, as appropriate
**** How to deal with passive optimization? 
*** (3) Create directories (repos) for each cell type (see above for protocol on this)  
*** (4) Think about the math -- evaluate each in terms of phase plane analysis; confer w/ Matt Garcia

****** Double-spiking cells w/ varying degrees of excitability (higher current required)
**** MA projection neurons
**** PV IN 
**** VIP IN

*** Transfer relevant data files from laptop onto desktop
**** Made a new dir on desktop: ~/Desktop/claustrum_data --> moving to ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/claustrum_data
**** This dir contains all the housekeeping files related to Martin's data. 
**** Current contents: 
***** *for_erica.xlsx* -- This is the original large excel file given to me by Martin, which has info on old / new ID, properties for each cell, and some graphs of the 11AP sorting.
***** *cell_type_list.xlsx* -- Given to me by Martin around 1/24/19 listing the main cell type groups and the new/old ID of each cell within each group.  
***** *abf_files_by_cellType.docx* -- Generated by me to reconcile abf names from for_erica.xlsx with the old/new ID information given to me on cell_type_list.xlsx

** Create Repository Structure 
*** How should this work? OPTIONS:
**** Archive claus repos on laptop & NEUROSIM 
**** On desktop -- what should be the parent directory? ~/Desktop or ~/Documents? Going for ~/Desktop 
**** So what should be the next step down from ~/Desktop? Should each cell type have its own directory? I feel like this is what makes the most sense. So if that's the case, to avoid it ballooning out of control, I will create a directory called ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM, and keep everything in there. 
*** First deal with desktop to NEUROSIM workflow: 
**** Made directory: ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/ which will contain work-related files
**** Moved claustrum_data to ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/claustrum_data --> this is not a git repository
**** Made 2 cell type dirs (on desktop): 
***** ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/SA1
****** Corresponding dir on NEUROSIM: /u/ericag/SA1 
****** Corresponding dir on laptop: ~/Desktop/
***** ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/SA2
****** Corresponding dir on laptop: ~/Desktop/
****** Corresponding dir on NEUROSIM: /u/ericag/SA2 
**** Initialized both cell type dirs as git repositories (git init) 
**** Edited config file in ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/SA1 & ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/SA2 
**** Created 2 cell type dirs on NEUROSIM: 
***** /u/ericag/SA1 (along with /u/ericag/SA1_bare)
***** /u/ericag/SA2 (along with /u/ericag/SA2_bare) 
**** Initialized both cell type dirs on NEUROSIM as git repositories (git init) 
**** Initialized both cell type bare directories on NEUROSIM as bare repos (git init --bare)

*** Now deal with laptop to NEUROSIM workflow:
**** Made 2 cell type directories: 
***** ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/SA1
***** ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/SA2 
**** Initialized both using git (git init)
**** Edited config files of each via SourceTree (Repositories --> Repository Settings --> Remotes --> Add --> name: origin, url: ssh://ericag@no.neurosim.downstate.edu/u/ericag/SA1_bare)
*** *NOTE* Got rid of test_repo on desktop & NEUROSIM 
*** So, now desktop, laptop, and NEUROSIM all have SA1 and SA2 repositories linked to SA1_bare and SA2_bare on NEUROSIM. 
* <2019-02-05 Tue -- A1 model>
** A1 repo notes:
*** NOTE: Focus is on A1 for now since ~fastest progress can be made (setting aside S1 for now)
*** samn A1 repo: https://bitbucket.org/samnemo/mtla1/src/default/
*** Preliminary model for A1 -- will move to NEUROSIM later
*** In bitbucket repo, samn says that the useful parts will be to "take some of the *cell types* and *connectivity params* + *size of cortical layers*, which differ in nonhuman primates (much bigger L2/L3) compared to rodents"

** Cell Types:
*** Bill says that the cell types should be the same as Fig. 1 in M1 paper:

** email from mgraf about filename structure: 
Hi Erica,

oh no sorry, i know the file names are  a mess to deal with. 
If i am not wrong you have all most abf files- at least the "old ID" abf files, right ? (should be around 380). SO they are accessible and the file name in the raw data abf folder corresponds to the "old ID". In the second tab with the abf file overview in your excel sheet, this old ID corresponds to the second number. So if you want to access a particular file that you find in the raw data overview, you need to check the 2nd number, go to the file folder and find c96 (c96 is the first cell in the dendrogram and has the new ID 59 and is on position 1).

Adi files are labelled as Axx and can be found in the Adi abf folder, "RC" files are retrobead labelled cells- I think those files you might not have.

The confusion comes from my decision to not label the raw abf files according to the "NEW ID" otherwise I had to relabel raw files...and as we went trough many different iterations of classification, it would have meant to relabel all abf files with each new iteration- so the new ID is to unify the names but you have to look at older ID tags to access the files in their respective older abf folders.

Messy but until we had a stable classification scheme I didnt want to rename everything... probably should for the sake of anyone else than me that has to work with the files. Will do it when I have some more time.

Best regards,
Martin

P.S> With that explanation, you should be able to find the files. NEW ID to find location in dendrogram, old ID to find abf file in abf-file folder. 

P.S.S> Do you have all raw abf files??

* <2019-03-08 Fri - A1 parameterization>
** PARAMETERS CHANGED TODAY:
*** Now have normalized layer boundaries
**** Normalized layer boundaries taken from original A1 github repo
**** now in netParams 
**** NOTE: Layer V has two parts --> E5R: 1250-1334 (0.625-0.667), E5B: 1334-1550(0.667-0.775)
*** Shape of column?? Unfinished, see below:  
**** cfg.sizeX, cfg.sizeY, cfg.sizeZ -- for M1 they are 400, 1350, 400. 
**** debate on slack: 
samn [1:56 PM]
is 1350 enough to span all layers with the params given for electrode locations?
400 x 400 ... maybe can look up radius for the electrodes used ... but can start with 400x400 for x,z

billl [1:57 PM]
we doing monkey here right? -- so wil be bigger
but that's another reason for using NCD (yfrac) since can maintain proportionality

samn [1:58 PM]
NCD sounds ok, have the layer sizes too from peter's placement
based on functional (responses to sounds)

samn [2:01 PM]
i emailed peter to ask ~radius from electrode

billl [2:01 PM]
in terms of the LFP spread? -- that's not really known is it?

samn [2:02 PM]
those numbers for layer sizes were given
based on his electrode placement

billl [2:02 PM]
guess could look at einevoll papers to see what they think

samn [2:02 PM]
not known - probably not exactly but might have estimates, yeah einevoll good

**** the size of the column will (eventually?) match up with what we are able to measure with a given electrode -- the electrode radius / LFP spread will help us get the area of the cylinder face, then the height should match up with the height of the layers. 
**** bill says to keep it simple for now, and samn agrees but wants to get the info anyway just to scale up if needed. 
*** netParams.popParams:
**** Essentially copied M1 netParams https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/netpyne/blob/development/examples/M1detailed/netParams.py, lines 210-225. 
**** However, did not fill in cellModel label, and kept ynormRange label values consistent w/ the layer dict described above (on line 62 currently) 
** [did not do] Look at pre-processing from Salva M1: 
*** conn.py, conn_long.py, conn_dend.py -- on neurosim -- check these files for M1 densities & to see pre-processing steps 
** QUESTIONS FOR SALVA: 
*** (1) for cellType in popParams --> where do IT, PT, SOM, PV, CT get defined? where is their 'cellRule'? 
*** (2) What is the deal with the reduced cells, etc around line 58, 80, etc. 

** Version Control:
*** scp lab nb to neurosim

** list of netParams.cellParams in netParams.py (line 63, M1_detailed)
*** *NOTE*: all this info is specified in the pkl file 
*** *NOTE*: the netParams.cellParams object keeps track of the cell rules which apply to the conditions specified in the cell rules 
*** IT5A_full: IT, HH_full, 0.42-0.52
*** IT2_reduced: IT, HH_reduced, 0.12-0.31

*** PV_simple: PV, HH_simple, no depth listed

*** PT5B_full: commented out 
*** *NOTE*: so, in popParams, whatever cells match the conditions set out in these rules will have the characteristics specified by the contents of the appropriate .pkl file. 
*** *NOTE*: SHOULD I CHANGE THESE DEPTHS? 

** Changes made today
*** changed cfg.scale = 2000.0 in cfg.py (under 'Network' section) bc seems like this is the total height specified by the layers info in the original A1 github repo -- check w/ Sam? 
*** Uncommented "General connectivity parameters" in netParams.py -- taking values from M1detailed 

** Parameters / Variables I need to define:
*** in netParams.py
**** netParams.scale = cfg.scale # Scale factor for number of cells
**** All general connectivity parameters (scaleConnWeight, etc. all the way to propLambda -- currently lines 44-50 under section "General connectivity parameters")
**** *QUESTION*: where do (line 45) netParams.scaleConnWeightModels dict labels called 'HH_simple', 'HH_reduced', and 'HH_full' get defined & used? 

*** in cfg.py
**** cfg.scale (under 'Network' (currently the last section))
**** cfg.scaleDensity 

** QUESTIONS FOR SAMN, SALVA, ETC:
*** should cfg.sizeY be set to 2000 since that is the total height we are working with re: the layers?
*** What should cfg.scale be set to? (cfg.py)
*** What should cfg.scaleDensity be set to? (cfg.py)
*** Should the 'general connectivity parameters' in netParams.py be set to the same values as M1 detailed? (Uncommented for now). 
*** In 'General connectivity parameters' --> HH_simple, HH_reduced, and HH_full are listed as dict labels in scaleConnWeightModels --> where do these get defined, used, etc.? 
*** For layer dict in netParams.py, I use the layer info specified by orig A1 github repo. There is also a boundary in M1 layer 5, similarly to A1 layer 5 -- the cell types in layer 5 are divided up in M1 -- should I use these cell devisions in A1 too? Word this better.

*** Put in cells for everything except for the ambiguous layers (IT5A, SOM5A, PV5A, IT5B, PT5B, SOM5B, PV5B) 

** Added cellDensity.pkl to A1/cells subdirectory, to load densities
** Connectivity: 
*** possibly use Sacha's file? 
*** use simplified M1? 
*** have to use a model with cell types similar to ours
** Re-read cortical microcircuit model paper 
** Getting to the bottom of the SOM_simple and PV_simple cell params objects, and by which populations they are used
*** commented out (in M1 detailed netParams.py), the PT5B_full block bc it is giving me hoc syntax errors when loading PTcell.hoc 
*** Yup, SOM_simple and PV_simple do not have depth requirements

** QUESTIONS TO ANSWER TOMORROW:
*** What to do about layer 5 / 45A?
*** should cfg.sizeY be set to 2000 vs 1350 because that is the height we are working with? 
*** Should cfg.scaleDensity in cfg.py be set to 0.01 like in M1_detailed? --> doing this for now
*** What about cfg.scale? 
*** Keep general connectivity params same as M1? 
*** Should I use the same cellDensity.pkl file as in M1?  --> doing this for now 
*** Should I use the same synaptic mechanism parameters as in M1 netParams.py? 
** *NOTE*: the cells subdir has NOT YET BEEN ADDED -- FIGURE THIS OUT TOMORROW 

* <2019-03-13 Wed -- Adding in A1 cell types from M1>
** Added cells subdir to my A1 git repo (on NEUROSIM, github, laptop, desktop) 
** Compare M1 (netpyne, salva) and A1 layers (orig samn git repo) and cell types:
*** Layer I [none]
*** Layer II:
**** A1 -- E2, I2, I2L
**** M1 -- IT2 (excitatory), SOM2, PV2 
*** Layer III [none]
*** Layer IV:
**** A1 -- E4, I4, I4L 
**** M1 -- IT4 (excitatory) 
*** Layer IV + top 1/2 of Layer V:
**** A1 -- none
**** M1 -- SOM5A, PV5A (both inhibitory)  
*** Layer V (entire layer):
**** A1 -- I5, I5L 
**** M1 -- none
*** Layer V (top section):
**** A1 -- E5R
**** M1 -- IT5A
*** Layer V (bottom section):
**** A1 -- E5B
**** M1 -- IT5B, PT5B (both excitatory), SOM5B, PV5B (both inhibitory) 
*** Layer VI:
**** A1 -- E6, I6, I6L
**** M1 -- IT6, CT6 (both excitatory); SOM6, PV 6 (both inhibitory) 

** Visual comparison of the above reveals that the major difference is that the bottom section of layer 5 & the entirety of layer 6 have 2 excitatory populations each (vs. 1 excitatory population observed in A1)

** Version control 
*** edited netParams.py in A1 on laptop 
*** to NEUROSIM
*** to GITHUB
*** to DESKTOP -- did not version control to desktop!!!

* <2019-03-14 Thu -- A1 cell types>
** Conclusion for cell types was to keep each layer w/ separately named cell populations. 
** Additional conclusion re: inhibitory pops in layers 5b & 6 was ambiguouts: 
*** see slack #auditory from 3/13/19 
** Get something running -- even if partial 
** Added all cell types from layer 5A and layer 5B and inhib populations from layer 4 
*** right now that means layer 2, 4, and 5A have 1 excitatory IT pop and 2 inhibitory pops (SOM and PV)
*** layer 5B has 2 excitatory pops (IT & PT) and 2 inhib (SOM & PV)
*** layer 6 has 2 excitatory pops (IT & CT) and 2 inhib (SOM & PV)
*** using density.pkl as it came in M1 detailed 
** Edited pkl files to change cell boundary layers remaining cell type files:
*** what was done so far: IT2_reduced_cellParams.pkl, IT4_reduced, IT6_reduced 
*** [done] CT6_reduced_cellParams.pkl:
**** Changed from 0.77 to 1.0  --> 0.775 to 1.0 (3 times)
*** IT5A_full_cellParams.pkl:
**** Changed from 0.42 - 0.52 --> 0.625 - 0.667 (3 times) 
*** IT5A_reduced_cellParams.pkl:
**** Changed from 0.42-0.52 to 0.625-0.667 (3 times) 
*** IT5B_reduced_cellParams.pkl:
**** changed from 0.52-0.77 --> 0.667-0.775
*** PT5B_reduced_cellParams.pkl:
**** changed from 0.52-0.77 --> 0.667-0.775 (3 times) 

** Added new subdir mod for mod files
*** Added MyExp2SynBB.mod & MyExp2SynNMDABB.mod 
*** must compile these mod files

** Sent email to Alan (yueyang) about optimization
** Stimulation for A1 model:
*** per cortex meeting: use white noise NetStim inputs as in M1
*** There are two sections in M1 netParams.py that I think have to do with inputs:
**** Current inputs (IClamp)
**** NetStim inputs 
**** Which of the above do I use? In meeting, NetStim was what was said, but look through the code to see what each does. 
**** added NetStim inputs section in cfg.py
** Added sections for current inputs & NetStim inputs in cfg.py & netParams.py 
** Connection scheme for A1 model:
*** Other models w/ cell types similar to us? 
*** Sacha? 
*** M1? 
** Find VIP interneuron info
** Find Layer I interneuron info 
** Other notes from meeting: keep general connectivity params the same (in netParams.py) until better data available

** Added NetStim inputs to every population in cfg.py 
*** This is under 'NetStim inputs' section of cfg.py 
*** cfg.NetStim1 thru cfg.NetStim17 because samn says that we should have background white noise input to every population
*** The keys/values of the cfg.NetStim dicts:
**** pop
**** ynorm -- [0,1]
**** sec -- 'soma' (should these all be 'soma'?)
**** loc -- '0.5' (should these all be 0.5?)
**** synMech -- 'AMPA' (should these all be AMPA?)
**** synMechWeightFactor -- [1.0]
**** start -- changing this from 500 to 0 
**** interval -- 1000.0/60.0
**** noise -- 0.0
**** number -- 60.0 (number of what? samn: "number of inputs") 
***** may change this to be the number of cells so inputs:cells goes 1:1? 
**** weight -- 30.0 (?)
**** delay -- 0
**** the values above indicate the first-pass test values, all grabbed from M1 odel (cfg.py) 

*** I made one NetStim per population (cfg.NetStim01, cfg.NetStim02, ... , cfg.NetStim 17) 
** Commeted out all text in IClamp section of netParams.py (A1) bc IClamp will not be used for now.

** Changed cfg.analysis['plotRaster'] so instead of just 'True' it reads: cfg.analysis['plotRaster'] = {'include': allpops, 'saveFig': True, 'showFig': True} --> testing now
** Made the weights in NetStim 10 (from 30), per samn's suggestion. Believe he thinks the synchrony in the firing is due to the inputs being too strong, but actually I think it's probably because I made them that way w/ the netstim values in cfg.py 
** *NOTE*: samn says that we will readjust the (frequency of) the inputs once the cells themselves are readjusted ("L5 pyramidal neurons have dendrites reaching into upper layers (1/2/3)")
** Next: Layer I interneurons (VIP?) & connection data

*** L1 interneurons important for setting circuit's phase (particularly important for inputs from pulvinar and thalamic relay matrix inputs):
**** samn [10:38 AM]
and again about the *importance of L1 interneurons, particularly for inputs from pulvinar and thalamic relay matrix inputs, important for setting circuit's phase*
a few days ago they did some experiments with lidocaine in thalamus, lidocaine apparently blocks ih...just mentioning since they're moving towards using targeted pharmacological manipulation of specific channels/populations and seeing if can dissect more info. on interneuron circuitry

** Had meeting today in #isb channel:
*** Read the following papers on L1 interneurons & circuitry:
**** 4 interneuron populations reside in neocortical layer 1
**** Potjans & Diesmann 
**** neocortical circuit: themes and variations 
**** inhibitory L5 paper 
**** interneurons of the neocort inhibitory system -- markram et al 
**** learning-related plasticity in dendrite-targeting L1 interneurons 
**** rapid neuromodulation of L1 interneurons
**** syn computatino & sensory processing in neocortical L2/3 
*** Figure out which 'class' of interneuron (VIP, SOM, PV) the NDNF interneurons belong in (probably VIP) in order to facilitate model building (potentially)
*** Feeling overwhelmed with respect to the interneuron stuff so maybe it would be helpful for me to just write out what I'm thinking? 
**** I don't know where to go to find the VIP interneurons. I guess I could go to modeldb, especially now that I know it doesn't matter if they are macaque or not, and just find one that is in NEURON. Then go to neuro-electro in order to modify for macaque. 
**** with respect to L1 -- read those papers in order to get a better sense of wtf is going on in terms of: electrophysiology & connectivity. Then I need to create a L1 interneuron population. How to do this? Steal some other interneuron stuff based on what 'category' they fall into (VIP?) and then modify based on the papers I'm reading... think that sounds like a plan. 
**** also wrt L1 -- look for models in the literature, even if not published
**** also look on BBP and HBP for models of either VIP or L1 interneurons 
*** RE: classifying the L1 interneurons based on their properties, pay attention to connectivity as well as GABA-synapse time constants 
** Harris & Sheperd 2015 (Themes and Variations) notes:
*** *EXCITATORY*:
*** Table 1 provides a summary of inputs / outputs of major excitatory cell classes
*** Figure 1 provides decent summary/diagram of where cells project to locally 
*** thalamic inputs to auditory cortex: 
**** "core-type axons from the ventral part of the MGN project to L4 and the L5/6 border"
**** "matrix-type afferents from dorsal & medial MGN project to layer 1 and subgranular layers but avoid L4" --> layer 1!! to the interneurons? 
**** refs: 26, 27 
*** L4 IT neurons: pyramidal, star-pyramidal, spiny stellate (spiny stellate are generally absent in A1! -- ref 45) 
*** thalamocortical inputs -- L4 in primary sensory regions receives 'massive core-type thalamic input but very few inputs from other thalamic or cortical areas"
*** [in A1] "L4 processing of TC inputs appears to depend critically on the precise timing of excitation and inhibition" ... "TC inputs excite not only L4 IT interneurons but also interneurons, resulting in rapid and powerful feedforward inhibition of ECs" (refs 51, 52) ... "because this inhibition arrives with a slight delay relative to excitation, it creates a narrow 'window of opportunity' for ECs to fire an accurately timed spike; furthermore, stimulus-dependent differences in the timing of excitatory input allow L4 IT neurons to respond selectively to specific stimuli." (refs 53, 54)
*** Essentially, circuitry of TC / intracortical circuits are tuned to create RECEPTIVE FIELDS in L4 neurons 
*** FIGURE 4 givews a good connectivity diagram of IT cells 
*** L4 IT neurons tend to be unidirectional (input from thalamus, output to other IT cells mostly)
*** Other IT cells have more bidirectional signaling
*** ALL POPS HAVE RECURRENT CONNECTIONS WITH CELLS IN THAT SAME POPULATION 
*** L6 IT may project to claustrum!! 
*** *INHIBITORY*
*** refs: 13, 116-118 for classification 
*** Most upstream: VIP (5HT3ra class) -- most abundant in L2/3
*** ^^ "narrowly-focused descending axon, a trait shared with lower L1 interneurons (single-bouquet cells"
*** ^^ both of these cell types receive strong excitatory input from cortico-cortical axons in L1 AND from local ECs (?) refs: 120, 123-125
*** ^^ bothy have ionotropic receptors for acetylcholine (nicotinic AChR) and serotonin 
*** Fig 6 has good info on directionality of inhibition 
*** VIP & L1 single-bouquet --| SST interneuron (--| EC dendrites) & PV basket cells (--| EC soma)  
*** "In A1.. locomotion decreases sensory responses in L2/3 IT & PV neurons... locomotion again increases activity of A1 VIP cells, which again inhibit SST & PV interneurons." (?) [evidently OPPOSITE of V1 even though hodology is conserved] 
*** Table 2 gives summary of interneuron types 
*** Where are the interneurons located, layer-wise? all of them in all layers? 
** Markram et al. 2003 (Interneurons of the Neocortical Inhibitory System):
*** "[Different classes of] interneurons are particularly specialized to target different domains of neurons (e.g. soma, dendrites), different layers of a column, and different columns." 
*** Fig 1 gives a summary of this domain-targeting difference. 
**** (combined with info from last paper):
**** NGF -- dendrite-targeting
**** Basket (PV) -- soma & proximal-dendrite targeting
**** Chandelier (PV) -- axon-targeting 
**** Martinotti (SST) -- dendrite & tuft-targeting 
**** Categories from prev paper not mention in Fig 1: VIP & L4 SST 
*** Most of this data is coming from RAT SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX 
*** Fig 2 gives approximate percentages of different Inhibitory cell types in Layers II-VI 
*** *Basket cells* -- typically *PV* cells (consistent w/ Harris & Sheperd 2015), and since they synapse on somata & proximal dendrites, evidently they are well-positioned to modulate the 'gain' of the integrated synaptic response (? -- still don't understand gain fully). 3 different types:
**** Large (never VIP) -- large, aspiny, multipolar dendrites. often multipolar but can be bitufted, pyramidal or bipolar. 
**** small (sometimes VIP, and some weird stuff going on w/ layer 4 -- often multipolar in L4 and bipolar or bitufted in L2/3) 
**** nest (never VIP) 
*** *Chandelier cells* -- typically *PV* cells (consistent w/ Harris & Sheperd), found in L2-L6 
**** Found in L2-L6
**** multipolar or bitufted
**** axonal synaptic location allows for powerful control due to direct 'editing' ability on AP output 
*** *Martinotti cells* -- always *SOM* (consistent) 
**** Found in L2-L6
**** project axons towards *layer 1*, where they "inhibit the tuft dendrites of pyramidal neurons" (Fig 1, supp) 
**** also project horizontally in layer 1, allowing for cross-columnar inhibition via L1 
**** Infragranular MCs (L5/6?) can selectively targe L4 
**** usually bitufted w/ more elaborate dendritic tree 
*** *Bipolar cells* -- typically *VIP* (not mentioned in Harris & Sheperd; VIP subclasses not addressed)
**** Occur in L2-L6 
**** small cells w/ spindle or ovoid somata
**** (bipolar or bitufted) dendrites extend twds L1 and down to L6 
**** excitatory if releasing VIP and inhibitory by releasing GABA 
*** *Double bouquet cells* -- typically *VIP* (not mentioned in Harris & Sheperd)
**** bitufted dendritic morphology 
**** occur in L2-L6
**** "in primates... interleaved wit pyramidal cells to inhibit their basal dendrites"
**** mainly dendritic targeting cells 
*** *Bitufted cells* -- can be *VIP* *SOM* but not PV (not mentioned in Harris & Sheperd) 
**** found in L2-L6
*** *NGF* -- not well studied
*** *L1 interneurons* -- not well-studied (2 groups noted here) 
**** Cajal Retzius cells -- large, multipolar w/ horizontal processes, present mostly during development
**** Heterogeneous group of small, multipolar interneurons w/ various axonal arborizations
*** Electrical types (refined, but not taking into account steady-state responses yet):
**** LTS --> L5, Martinotti (SST, consistent w/ H&S) and Double-bouquet (typically VIP)
**** RSNP --> L2/3 & L5, Martinotti (SST), Double-bouquets (typically VIP), bipolar cells (typically VIP)
**** LS --> L2/3 & L5, NGCs (neurogliaform, consistent with H&S)
**** IS (irregular) --> L2/3 & L5, bipolar cells (typically VIP)
**** VIP cells thus mostly regular & late spiking, with some amount of irregular spiking 
*** The rest of this paper may get too granular -- skim it again tomorrow then move on. 
** FOR TOMORROW -- need to look for VIP interneuron model from any species, verify that it looks vaguely okay electrophysiologically, then look on neuro-electro & at more literature & BBP/HBP to find electro properties of macaque VIP and substitute with that. (If connectivity can be used as a criteria then sure, need to determine connectivity patterns in the literature then look at connectivity patterns in the available model(s); need to also look at time constants in the literature and neuro-electro and whatnot, and make sure that data is reflected in the model or in my modifications of the model). 
** Same applies for layer 1 interneurons -- read more about them in the literature. decide how to proceed later (look at HBP/BBP and at literature for models. or look at what they are closest to -- NGF VIP? how do they differ?) 
   
* <2019-03-28 Thu -- VIP interneuron search>
** (1) get VIP model from modeldb:
https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel.cshtml?model=246546&file=/Turi_et_al_2018/cells/vipcr_cell.hoc#tabs-2
** (2) Modify compartments so down from ~15 to ~5ish:
*** Load in cell and see what firing is like at different current injections
*** Reduce compartments and see how it changes 

** (3) Modify w/ data about macaque VIP:
*** info from neuroelectro:
*** info from literature: 
** Downloaded vipcr_cell.hoc on Desktop into ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1/cells/vipcr_cell.hoc 
** Next: look at firing pattern by loading cell into neuron/netpyne 
** Testing VIP CR cell:
*** Added to ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1/mod/:
**** nafcr.mod
**** kdrcr.mod
**** ikscr.mod
**** iccr.mod
**** vipcr_cell.hoc imports kadcr -- > NOT seeing a .mod file for this in the modeldb repo
**** cancr.mod
**** cadyn.mod --> NOT replaced (there is one there already), keep this
*** Compiled mod files
*** Error regarding lambda_f:

0.0

>>> lambda_f = 100

>>> h.load_file('cells/vipcr_cell.hoc')

1.0
*** samn says to define it in the .hoc file, so I added lambda_f = 100 as the very top line per hoc documentation 
*** Error w/ importing Nafcr:
**** changed to insert nafcr because modfile is nafcr.mod 
**** changed gnarbar_Nafcr to gnafbar_nafcr for same reason 
**** changed back because in nafcr.mod it is capitalized 
**** changed name of mod file to Nafcr.mod -- changed back
**** okay back to original everything... why is this happening? 
**** fixed by re-compiling everything (deleting symbolic link in main A1 dir first though : rm -f x86_64) 
** VIP_test_orig.py (in ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1): file will load the original vipcr_cell.hoc file 
** Version control:
*** Github
**** go to A1_bare on neurosim

*** Laptop
*** Desktop (done -- working from desktop)
*** Lab_NB 
**** desktop (done)
**** laptop

** Now changed original vip cell hoc file to vipcr_cell_orig.hoc and changed this in VIP_test_orig.py as well [[tested & works]] 
** I made a copy of this .hoc file and it is named vipcr_cell.hoc and this is what I will be editing! 

** Created a copy of the VIP test python file and named it *VIP_test_edited.py* and it imports *vipcr_cell.hoc* from /cells in order to work. /tested/ --> runs 


   
** Suggestion from Salva & samn regarding compartments: 
samn [10:39 AM] 
public soma
public radProx1, radMed1, radDist1, lmM1, lmt1
public radProx2, radMed2, radDist2, lmM2, lmt2
public oriProx1, oriMed1, oriDist1
public oriProx2, oriMed2, oriDist2

salvadord [10:39 AM]
so ~15 comps… maybe can reduce to those main labels: soma, rad, lm, ori ? whatever those mean…ç

** What is the current organization / shape of the cell? --> soma w/ 4 protrusions 


** Version control so can work on laptop -- before leaving for downstate this afternoon! 
*** desktop --> neurosim
**** git add & commit 
**** git push ssh://ericag@no.neurosim.downstate.edu/u/ericag/A1_bare

** @ downstate --> commented out basic shape pt3dadd lines, and got rid of all original compartment names and replaced them with rad1, rad2, ori1, and ori2, which I made by essentially collapsing all of the former compartments together. 

** TOMORROW: test out new vipcr_cell.hoc with different diameters for the new compartments and compare to original firing rate / pattern, scp lab_notebook.org into all the right places (desktop has most recent copy, so laptop and neurosim)
* <2019-03-29 Fri -- testing VIP interneuron>
** Changed synapses in vipcr_cell.hoc (recall vipcr_cell_orig.hoc is the original .hoc file):
*** synapses: 
**** AMPA EC: lmM1 & lmM2 --> rad1 & rad2
**** AMPA CA3 Shaffer: radMed1, radMed2, radProx1, radProx2 --> rad1 & rad2
**** AMPA PC: oriProx1, oriProx2 --> ori1 & ori2
**** GABA-A Septum: oriProx1, oriProx2 --> ori1 & ori2
**** GABA-B Septum: oriProx1, oriProx2 --> ori1 & ori2 
*** For the above, I should note the original location of these synapses on the new consolidated compartments --> commented in vipcr_cell.hoc file 
** Works/ w new synapse configuration.

** Seems like new edited version of the VIP CR cell is less excitable (see above), etc. but put it in the model for now and then continue adjusting after we establish connectivity, since we may have to adjust lengths of dendrites, etc. 
** On DESKTOP computer (princess putey), I moved VIP_test_orig.py and the VIP_test_figs directory to the archived_files directory (will do the same with VIP_test_edited.py once I put the VIP cells into the model -- want to use it as a reference first)

** QUESTIONS ABOUT VIP in model:
*** Should I save this as a pkl file like the other cells? If so, how? 
**** salva says to set netParams.saveCellParams to True 
**** Try this in VIP_test.py first 
**** saveCellParams = True did not work --> seems obvious; what would this even do?

** TASK 1: VIP pkl file -- conclusion: VIP_simple_cellParams.pkl in cells subdir  
*** Lines 68-74 in netParams.py name all the populations of cells and then load their .pkl files 
*** Figure out how to get VIP pkl file like the rest of them 
*** Salva says: 'check the m1 netParams — when the flag `saveCellParams` is set to true it calls a func to save the params to a pkl file'
*** in A1/netParams.py --> adding saveCellParams = True
*** Already did this in A1/VIP_test/VIP_netParams.py --> but was this enough? WHAT gets saved w/ this saveCellParamsRule
*** There exists (UNCOMMITTED, on DESKTOP), two files in A1/cells which were saved via the above script to .pkl files. But are they correct? 
*** Try using what M1 model does for SOM & PV 
**** e.g. ## SOM cell params (3-comp) -- lines 187-193 in M1detailed/netParams.py 
if 'SOM_simple' not in loadCellParams:
    cellRule = netParams.importCellParams(label='SOM_simple', conds={'cellType':'SOM', 'cellModel':'HH_simple'}, 
      fileName='cells/LTS3.hoc', cellName='LTScell1', cellInstance = True)
    cellRule['secLists']['spiny'] = ['soma', 'dend']
    netParams.addCellParamsWeightNorm('SOM_simple', 'conn/SOM_simple_weightNorm.pkl', threshold=cfg.weightNormThreshold)
    netParams.saveCellParamsRule(label='SOM_simple', fileName='cells/SOM_simple_cellParams.pkl')
**** Changed all instances of SOM to VIP and commented out cellRule['secLists...] and netParams.addCellParamsWeight... lines 
**** Can I just execute these lines without the rest of the script and generate a .pkl file that will work? 
**** did not load the file properly ^^ 
**** ok so where am I now... I have taken out the VIP cell params stuff from above ^^ 
**** in A1/cells I copied VIP_edited_cellParams.pkl and renamed it VIP_simple_cellParams.pkl and added 'VIP_simple' to cellParamLabels list. Now it loads this pkl file and it seems to have all the relevant sections & mechanisms from the edited cell file. 
**** NEXT: (1) see how it differs if I use original VIP (VIP_orig_cellParams.pkl) 
***** change cellParamLabels list to have 'VIP_orig' rather than  'VIP_simple'
***** yup -- this one loads the larger model; change back 
**** NEXT: (2) how did I generate this pkl file?  
***** Used VIP_test_compare.py in A1/VIP_test and generated 2 pkl files, one with original (vipcr_cell_orig.hoc) and one edited (vipcr_cell.hoc)
***** Try again in A1/VIP_test directory to see if this generates the same pkl files 
***** yes -- so, script to generate is in A1/VIP_test/VIP_test_compare.py, which has lines to save the files (below)
# Adding this in order to save params as a pkl file 
##saveCellParams = True 
for i in range(0,len(allpops)):
    netParams.saveCellParamsRule(label=allpops[i],fileName=allpops[i]+'_cellParams.pkl')
##^^ This was fileName='cells/'+allpops[i]+'_cellParams.pkl') 
    **
**** CONCLUSION: the VIP_simple_cellParams.pkl file in A1/cells is generated using VIP_test_compare.py in A1/VIP_test
**** and VIP_simple_cellParams.pkl is the same as VIP_edited_cellParams.pkl in VIP_test 
**** ^^ used 'diff' command to compare 
*** CONCLUSION: Use VIP_simple_cellParams.pkl located in A1/cells to load VIP_simple cell (the edited of the original vip cell -- from https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel.cshtml?model=246546&file=/Turi_et_al_2018/cells/vipcr_cell.hoc#tabs-2)

** non-VIP (NGF) cells:
*** Workflow:
**** *Just make one population*
**** Start with VIP cells as a template 
**** Optimize cell type 
**** In terms of density -- should I get rid of them in layers that are not L1? 
*** What was the justification for using VIP cell as a template? Look in NB and on slack. --> *because VIP and NGF cells are both subsets of 5HT marked cells* 
*** NOTE: moved optimization figures from desktop (of laptop) to ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1/figures
*** NOTES on NGF cells from the literature:
**** 'Electrophysiological Differences Between Neurogliaform Cells From Monkey and Rat Prefrontal Cortex'
***** rat NGF -- late-spiking cells (not so for monkey NGF)
***** monkey NGF -- higher input resistance, lower spike threshold, higher firing frequency, more spike adaptation 
*** Potential extant models:
**** https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel.cshtml?model=187604&file=/modeldbca1/cells/class_ngfcell.hoc#tabs-2
**** BBP S1 has a NGF cell -- messaged sid for pointer in the right direction 
*** Test-load potential model found on modeldb (https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel.cshtml?model=187604&file=/modeldbca1/cells/class_ngfcell.hoc#tabs-2):
**** download hoc file: ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1/cells/ngf_cell.hoc
**** download corresponding mod files 
**** make copies and test first in ~/Desktop/test_ngf 
***** mkdir ~/Desktop/test_ngf
***** put in all mod files and .hoc file (same dir -- no subdirs)
***** compile w/ nrnivmodl in above directory 
**** Changes I am making to test_ngf_simple.hoc file (in ~/Desktop/test_ngf):
***** deleting "// external variables" in beginning of file bc I suspect these are coming from external files that I am not loading 
***** commented out synapse stuff in proc init:
// synapses
	//pre_list = new List() // define a list for the presynaptic connections
	//define_synapses($3)	// local fcn: define all possible synaptic connections received by this cell
***** deleting gid and randi in proc_init because seems like this has to do with parallel processing:
(proc init() {
	//gid = $1
	//randi = $2)

****** "HEAD" points to the branch that you are working on
******* e.g. [[~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1/figures/git_help/head.png]]
****** To switch to the branch you created: =git checkout name_of_branch=
******* "HEAD" switches to testing branch
******* [[~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1/figures/git_help/switch.png]]
****** If you commit, this moves "HEAD" along the the branch:
******* e.g. [[~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1/figures/git_help/head_commit.png]]
****** To switch back to "master" branch: =git checkout master=
****** To merge: =git merge name_of_branch]=
****** To delete branch: =git branch -d name_of_branch=

** Version control
*** github

*** laptop
*** neurosim
*** comet 
** Importing NGF cell into netParams.py (commented out for now) 
** Edited name of NGF cell hoc file to ngf_cell.hoc (in cells subdir) 
** Edited test_ngf.py in A1 in order to import correct .hoc file (updated name) 
** Cut out extraneous parts of ngf_cell.hoc (now reflects what is in test dir on laptop) 
** Still need to lower the threshold -- work on SOMA FIRST 
** SOMA EDITS:
*** right now soma has Nav channel (ch_Navngf), Kdr_fast channel (ch_Kdrfastngf), and leak channel (ch_leak)
*** In the original file, all sections (thus, including soma), also had:
**** iconc_Ca
**** ch_KvAngf
**** ch_CavN
**** ch_CavL
**** ch_KCas
**** ch_KvCaB
**** ek = -90, eca = 130, e_ch_leak = -60
**** iconc_CaZ=2 (CaZ? iconc_Ca=2?) 
*** Adding proximal A-type potassium (ch_KvAngf) -- *fewer spikes*, went from 4 to 2 at 1.9nA current input (way too high still) 
*** Adding HAV-N channel (T-type calcium, ch_CavN) -- 2 spikes, but *closer together* (when added by itself, still 4 spikes) 
*** Adding L-type calcium channel (ch_CavL)  -- hard to say what effect this had
*** Adding small potassium channel, calcium gated (ch_KCaS) 
*** Before this line ^^ added iconc_Ca -- since small potassium channel is calcium gated, now having the calcium iconc_Ca mech in there made a difference
*** Adding big potassium channel (v- and ca-gated, ch_KvCaB) -- didn't seem to make too much difference 
*** did all this in test_ngf.hoc --> doing it in A1 copy now 
** *VERSION CONTROL CHECKPOINT*

** Noticing that the dendritic components have a lot more relevance than I thought they would -- taking away soma Na/K channels didn't actually eliminate action potentials - why is this? 
** *PROBLEM*: first spike will not go away
** *HYPOTHESES* & *POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS*:
*** (1) fast sodium channel is too fast to activate compared to the a-type potassium -- not supressed until after the first spike
**** Make sodium channel activation time constant slower
**** Make potassium channel activation time constant faster
**** Add a faster activating potassium channel into the mix? 
*** (3) May need a D-type potassium channel, as mentioned by sam? 
*** (4) Try a slower sodium channel 
*** (5) Try a faster potassium channel 
** TRIED SOLUTIONS:
*** *TRIED* (2) channel in soma alone is not good enough 
**** place in dendrites to see if there is an effect -- start with 1 dendrite and work your way up 
**** did rad1 
**** did rad1 and rad2 
**** Definitely increasing the firing threshold overall, but there is still an initial depolarization, so adding it to other dendrites isn't the problem

* <2019-07-30 Tue -- NGF cell modifications + connectivity data>
** NGF cells:
*** Add Ih to NGF cells
**** Using Migliore 2010 (h_migliore.mod)
**** Already present in A1/mod, but added it to cells/NGF_optimization
**** Recompile with nrnivmodl (rm -r x86_64 --> nrnivmodl) 
**** Add channel mechanism to ngf_cell.hoc
***** suffix: hd (found in mod file)
***** added to ngf_cell.hoc, in proc init(): insert hd, gbar_hd = 0.0001 
**** Test addition of channel mechanism:
***** created test_ngf.py on local machine just to see if it loads
***** python -i test_ngf.py --> WORKS
***** add test_ngf.py to git repo to test compile success on comet & neurosim
**** Add both files (ngf_cell.hoc & h_migliore.mod) to git repo
**** Re-compile in remote directories on COMET and NEUROSIM 
***** NEUROSIM: nrnivmodl in /u/ericag/A1/cells/NGF_optimization (no need to re-compile in main A1 directory because this mod file is already present) 
***** COMET: nrnivmodl in /home/eyg42/A1/cells/NGF_optimization 
***** Test re-compile by running test_ngf.py in .../cells/NGF_optimization subdir on COMET and NEUROSIM
****** DO NOT FORGET TO DO conda activate py36 in NEUROSIM or else will get outdated version of python 
****** Works on comet & neurosim (test_ngf.py) 
**** *NOTE*: Modify gmax only during optimization
*** Take care of netpyne clone problem for NGF now on COMET and NEUROSIM
***** cd ~/A1/cells/NGF_optimization
***** git clone -b development https://github.com/neurosim-lab/netpyne.git
***** cd netpyne; git checkout development ('Already on 'development'')
***** cd .. (make sure in ~/A1/cells/NGF_optimization)
***** mv netpyne netpyne_temp
***** cd netpyne_temp
***** mv netpyne ../netpyne
***** TEST: python, import netpyne, netpyne.__file__ should return: optimization_directory/netpyne/__init__.py --> WORKED on both COMET and NEUROSIM
*** Extract sag data from Fig 3B of paper mentioned yesterday (see nb entry)
*** Separate passive and active optimization
**** Start with passive: do grid search using netpyne
**** Create new fitness functions for active optimization
** Connectivity data:
*** Started new tab in gdrive spreadsheet entitled "FINAL DATA"
* <2019-08-01 Thu -- netParams changes>
** Separating L2/3 into L2 and L3 
*** netParams.py changes:
**** LAYER BOUNDARIES:
***** Cell parameters section change:
****** BEFORE: layer = {....'2': [0.05, 0.475]....{
****** NOW: layer = {...'2': [0.05, 0.08], '3': [0.08, 0.475]...} 
****** SOURCE: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2014.00081/full
****** In the above source, L2 is approx 15% of total L2/3 depth, based on proportions found in figures. Thus, made L2 approx 15% of total L2/3 depth as well. 
***** Population parameters change:
****** Added ### LAYER 3 section w/ appropriate pops
****** Changed their names from IT2 --> IT3, etc. (changed name only)
**** DENSITIES:
***** '## load densities' loads a cellDensity.pkl file which needs to be modified first. 
***** Then, pop densities in  ### Layer 2 and ### Layer 3 (in # Population parameters) needs to be modified  
**** CELL TYPES:
***** in cellParamLabels, need to add in IT3 cell pops by name
***** need to also MAKE these pkl files or something?? 
**** netParams.version = 2
*** cfg.py changes:
**** in #Recording section, added the following to allpops: 'IT3', 'SOM3', 'PV3', 'VIP3'
**** added in Layer 3 pops to cfg.addNetStim in #NetStim inputs section 
** Added in Layer 1 netstims to cfg.py and L1 pops to 'allpops' also in cfg.py 
** Adding in L4 Spiny Stellate cells:
*** Changing IT4 into ITP4 (pyramidal) and ITS4 (stellate)
*** netParams.py changes:
**** In '#Population parameters' section, modified ## LAYER 4 so now netParams.popParams['IT4'] --> netParams.popParams['ITP4'] and netParams.popParams['ITS4']
**** DENSITY FOR THESE NEEDS TO BE CHANGED <-- similarly for L2 and L3 
*** cfg.py changes:
**** 'allpops' in #Recording section now includes 'ITP4' and 'ITS4' instead of 'IT4'
**** netstims --> changed to netstims to IT4 now go to ITP4 and ITS4 
*** netParams.version = 3

**** All mod files are in this directory, along with .hoc file (with Ih mechanism), and a test_ngf.py script to ensure it can get properly loaded in (checked -- works)
**** Created *NGF_evol_passive.py*

***** RMP = -67 #+/- 5mV 
**** Change paths:
***** if machine_ID == 'COMET': data_path_stem = '/oasis/scratch/comet/eyg42/temp_project/A1/NGF_passive/NGF_batch_data_gen_' --> NEEDS TO BE CREATED *[DONE]*

***** if machine_ID == 'zn': data_path_stem = '/u/ericag/A1/cells/NGF_optimization/NGF_passive/NGF_batch_data_gen_' --> *DONE* NEEDS A GIT REPO UPDATE ON NEUROSIM TO MEAN ANYTHING
**** Changed how script determines which data files are completed:
***** compare data_files_DONE to data_files_NEEDED using sort and == 
**** Changed fitness functions:
***** RMP
****** CODE:

RMP_fitness = abs(RMP_sim-RMP)^2 # RMP defined in main code
****** squared the difference btwn target and result as well (see above) 
***** SUBTHRESHOLD RESPONSES fitness changed as well 
**** added fitnesses to fitnessCandidates 
*** NGF_batch_passive.py changes:

**** Change paths: 
***** in b.runCfg (in runType == hpc_slurm), added NGF_passive to *folder* path --> 'folder': '/home/eyg42/A1/cells/NGF_optimization/NGF_passive' 
***** in b.saveFolder for hpc_slurm runType --> '/oasis/scratch/comet/eyg42/temp_project/A1/NGF_passive/' (formerly last part of path was just 'NGF') 
*** Compiled mod files in NGF_passive on comet & neurosim & local  
** TO DO: Change the params being modified by NGF_evol_passive.py!! 
* <2019-08-07 Wed -- NGF passive>
** Try writing the fitness functions as actual functions to be called later 
** What params should be modified? 
*** Channels present:
**** ch_Navngf.mod: "sodium channel (voltage dependent, higher threshold)"
**** ch_Kdrfastngf.mod: "Fast delayed rectifier potassium channel (voltage dependent, for neurogliaform family)"
**** ch_leak.mod: leak conductance (voltage independent) 
**** h_migliore.mod: I-h channel from Magee 1998 for distal dendrites
**** ch_KvAngf.mod: Proximal A-type potassium 
**** ch_CavN: T-type calcium
**** ch_CavL: L-type calcium 
**** iconc_Ca.mod: intracellular calcium accumulation
**** ch_KCaS: small K+ channel; calcium gated
**** ch_KvCaB: Big K+ channel; voltage & ca2+ gated
*** samn: for passive parameters usually fit the *leak channel density/reversal*, and *capacitance*
*** ^^ Per advice above, should modify: gmax_ch_Navngf, ena, and cm
** NGF_evol_passive.py changes:
*** Changed re-write lines to pertain to the correct params and the correct lines in netParams.py
*** Changed num_inputs to 3 
** NGF_netParams.py changes:
*** Added 3 lines at the end for gmax, ena, and cm 
*** Commented out soma vinit line for now (set to RMP? meh) 

** Committed changes -- try running:
*** local
**** ERROR: in *NGF_evol_passive.py* no module named NGF_batch --> RESOLVED; changed to NGF_batch_passive (along with call from NGF_batch_passive to batch_full() function) [actually discovered on zn]
**** ERROR: in *NGF_batch_passive.py*, syntax error in params['amp'] --> RESOLVED (period instead of comma) 
**** ERROR: in *NGF_evol_passive.py* out of range --> Did not fill in min or max params in main code --> RESOLVED
**** ERROR --> did not throw an error, but *NGF_evol_passive.py* did not work properly for finding finished data files. Fixed this part of the code and tested some parts locally. Try local run again to see if resolved. --> RESOLVED after using .issubset -- was comparing one set of data files which contained .json results files from all candidates in the generation, and then a set of data files with only 1 candidate's results. 
**** ERROR --> index out of range in line 131 in *NGF_evol_passive.py* --> am currently indexing by the larger set mentioned in the last point; try indexing by the smaller one to see if this resolves. 
**** ERROR --> another index out of range in *NGF_evol_passive.py* , but this might be caused by syntax problem in subthreshold_deltas definition in main code --> it was; RESOLVED
**** WORKS -- funkiness occurred with generation because I set the pop sizes and whatnot so low for testing; don't worry about this now. 
**** CHANGED RUN PARAMS (increased pop sizes and whatnot) -- now test on zn 
*** zn
**** pulled all changes listed above 
**** ssh into zn from no
**** cd /u/ericag/A1
**** conda activate py36
**** screen -L python NGF_evol_passive.py --> RUNNING NOW; DETACH (crtl+a d) 
**** To return: screen -r 
**** ERROR --> user error; input 'LOCAL' instead of 'zn' when entering machine_ID -- try again. BUT, [DONE] fix the thing below first re: mean_responses calculated only after delay 
**** Trying again 
*** comet 
** TO DO: 
*** Change comet run so uses shared partition 
*** [DONE] mean_responses[i] = steady_state_response

** Changed cfg.duration from 1.5*1e3 to 1.1*1e3 (1100 ms accounts for stim delay and stim input) 
* <2019-08-09 Fri -- NGF passive>
** Not sure why, but optimization stalled on 'zn' after only 7 runs 
** Adding a 'partition' option to batch run:
*** Changing hpc_slurm b.runCfg to add a 'partition' option for 'shared' -- let's see if this works. --> did NOT work 
*** Trying 'custom': '#SBATCH -p=partition' (adding to b.runCfg) [per salva's suggestion]
*** sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Job violates accounting/QOS policy (job submit limit, user's size and/or time limits)
*** ^^ shared partition can only use 1 node at a time, I believe (true), and example on comet user guide (https://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/comet.html) shows only using 8 cores per node. Changing this in batch script (from 24 'coresPerNode' to 8) 
*** With the above changes, seems to be working on *comet* 
*** Changing 'coresPerNode' from 8 to 1 in b.runCfg for runType == 'hpc_slurm' because should only require one core. 
* <2019-08-11 Sun -- NGF passive on google cloud>
** Salvador ran ~1000 generations successfully on google cloud
** Suggestions for improvement:
*** Ran out of space -- save cfg and netParams to output, but do not plot trace
**** Commented out in *NGF_cfg.py*: cfg.analysis['plotTraces'] = {'include': [0], 'saveFig': True} 
*** Turn on logging for each generation 
**** https://aarongarrett.github.io/inspyred/troubleshooting.html#use-and-consult-the-logs
**** added 'import logging' to import section of *NGF_evol_passive.py* 
* <2019-08-15 Thu -- active setup & passive modifications>
** Sleep interval changes:
*** Sleep interval decreased from 1 to 0.1 (per salva's advice) in *NGF_evol_passive.py*
*** But... salva's advice was for runCfg to be changed, so I changed it in *NGF_cfg.py* as well 
*** Need to update netpyne to see 
** Netpyne update (development branch pulled):
*** http://www.netpyne.org/install.html
*** =git clone https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/netpyne.git=
*** =cd netpyne=
*** =git checkout development=

** Test the above on comet to see if this lowers time/generation

** running on zn because comet is arbitrarily crashing: 
*** ERROR:
*** Solutions:
**** contact help desk
**** have salva show me how to deploy gcloud cluster 
** Changes to NGF_evol_passive.py for evol run:
*** added fn_stem and fn_EMO to 'if machine_ID ==' block for ease of use in the custom observer functions. 
*** widened the range of gmax param
** Changes to NGF_evol_passive.py & NGF_batch_passive.py for data dir on zn:
*** changed runType=='mpi_bulletin' statements about data dirs to include NGF_passive/data/ + batchLabel, etc. (new thing is the 'data' subdir of NGF_passive -- created on neurosim server already) 
*** Changed corresponding lines in NGF_evol_passive.py 
** TRANSFERRED REPO TO suny-downstate-medical-center/neurosim (organization/team) for widened access. On each system (comet, no, and local, changed git remote):
*** (1) git remote -v (to check)
*** (2) git remote set-url origin https://github.com/suny-downstate-medical-center/A1.git 
*** (3) git remote -v (to check again)  

** *Why* are all the fitness values the same on the comet run?? Run this on zn for a day and check back in. (the 'g' in ch_leak?) 
** Compiled mod files on 'no' in /u/ericag/A1/cells/NGF_optimization/NGF_passive, using =nrnivmodl=
** Recall, on 'zn', 2 things necessary to do to the environment:
*** conda activate py36

*** automate data directory clearance before each run 
* <2019-08-27 Tue -- NGF cell hand-tuning + connectivity data>

** Hand-tune NGF cell:
*** (on laptop) mkdir ~/Desktop/NGF_cell
*** Populate this directory with the correct files 
*** nrnivmodl to compile; python -i test_ngf.py to test: WORKING
*** Modify 
*** GOALS:
**** RMP = -67mV 
***** Took out ch_leak and added 'insert pas' instead
***** Changed e_pas in ngf_cell.hoc in order to get good RMP 
**** Get down to -105mV with -0.12 amp input
***** With params below, -66.99 --> -67.08 with -0.12 nA input
cm = 1

// LEAK CHANNEL
e_pas = -67.10
g_pas = 0.001 //0.001 is default

// Ih for SAG 
gbar_hd = 0.0001
***** Change cm:
****** Increase --> "smoother" changes in voltage (makes sense; holds onto charge better?) 
***** Change g_pas:
****** Increase --> 
****** Decrease --> 
* <2019-08-28 Wed -- NGF>
** GIT VERSION CONTROL NUMBERS:
*** a599dd8
*** be123e8
** deleted 'email' line for runType hpc_slurm in NGF_batch_passive.py
** added 'nodes': 1 and 'coresPerNode': 24 to runType mpi_bulletin in NGF_batch_passive.py 
** Increased sleepinterval to 0.3 in evol and batch_passive scripts. 
** THINGS TO DEAL WITH:
*** "NONE" values being decoded 
*** Sleep Interval --> increased from 0.1 to 0.5 in evol and batch
*** email on comet --> deleted from b.runCfg in batch
*** num_elites --> go from 1 to 0
*** final pop print lines? 
*** pas mechanism: ch_leak or pas? 
*** add another compartment? (dend)? 
*** logging? 
*** ec.observers.stats_observer recoverable in multi-objective? 
*** no plotting from netpyne -- how to achieve this?  
*** automate data directory move before each run

**** L6 Pyramidal (M/L) [1/2, not counting inverted]
**** L6 Star Pyramidal (Apical & Basal??) 
** Steps:
*** Figure out how to load .pkl files in A1/cells
**** (1) python; import pickle; with open('FILENAME.pkl','rb') as fileObj: data = pickle.load(fileObj, encoding='bytes')
***** The encoding='bytes' resolves the following error: *UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xfa in position 2: ordinal not in range(128)* 
**** (2) netParams.loadCellParamsRule(label='CT6_reduced',fileName='CT6_reduced_cellParams.pkl')
*** Start with modification of L2 Excitatory cells
**** Excitatory Pop in the model: IT2
**** IT2 needs apical dendrites in L2 and in L1 
**** L1 normalized layer boundaries: [0.00, 0.05] --> 0-100
**** L2 normalized layer boundaries: [0.05, 0.08] --> 100-160
**** File: A1/cells/IT2_reduced_cellParams.pkl
***** LOAD file:
****** with python; import pickle; from netpyne import specs; netParams.loadCellParamsRule(label='IT2_reduced',fileName='IT2_reduced_cellParams.pkl')
***** 3 apical dendrites & 1 basal dendrite
***** Current geometry of Adend1:
****** netParams.cellParams['IT2_reduced']['secs']['Adend1']['geom']
****** diam = 1.5831889597
****** L: 96.75
****** pt3d: [[0, 48.4123467666, 0, 1.5831889597], [0, 145.1623467666, 0, 1.5831889597]]}
***** Current geometry of Adend2:
****** diam: 1.5831889597
****** L: 96.75
****** pt3d: [[0, 145.1623467666, 0, 1.5831889597], [0, 241.9123467666, 0, 1.5831889597]]
***** Current geometry of Adend3: 
****** diam: 1.5831889597
****** L: 96.75
****** pt3d: [[0, 241.9123467666, 0, 1.5831889597], [0, 338.66234676659997, 0, 1.5831889597]]
**** I need IT2 to go from within L2 (100-160, 0.05 - 0.08), up to within L1 (0-100, 0 - 0.05). Max length is therefore 160 (160 --> 0), and min length is ~0 (100-100). If cell body located approximately in the middle of L2 (~130, 0.065) and dendrite extends to approximately middle of L1 (~50, 0.025), then dendrite length would be ~80 (0.065 --> 0.025). 
**** Shorten pt3d and L for apical dendrites
*** Questions:
**** RESOLVED:
***** What is the total depth of the model? --> *2000*
***** How to correlate length with normalized layer depth? 
****** I: 0-100 
****** II: 100-160
****** III: 160-950 
****** IV: 950-1250
****** VA: 1250-1334
****** VB: 1334-1550
****** VI: 1550-2000
***** What do the values in pt3d correspond to? 
****** x, y, z, diam
****** https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/py_doc/modelspec/programmatic/topology/geometry.html
***** How to modify the lengths when there is a pt3d? 
***** Do I modify all apical dendrites or just one? 
**** This wiring diagram does not explicitly show pyramidal cell bodies in L4, only sort of spiny stellate.  
**** What do I do about L5A / L5B? 
**** For cells that appear to have synapses along the dendrite in multiple superior layers, do I need to just adjust one dendrite to be long enough to reach through all of the layers or do I need to make different ones for each layer that it goes through? Probably just one and have them synapse...? 
* <2019-09-12 Thu -- dendrite adjustments>
** All of these changes are happening on laptop in ~/Desktop/cells
** Using script cell_save.py with function change_geom(cellName,L) which will change pt3d and L (in geom)
** Pops that need to extend to L1 [L5 pop UNFINISHED]:
*** IT2
**** IT2_reduced_cellParams.pkl --> IT2_reduced_new.pkl
**** midpoint to midpoint strategy as noted by salva: 50 is midpoint of L1, 130 is midpoint of L2, so L = 80
**** cd ~/Desktop/cells/ ; python ; import cell_save ; cell_save.change_geom('IT2_reduced, 80)
*** IT3
**** Does not have a separate pkl file right now
**** Is there anything in the pkl file for IT2_reduced_cellParams.pkl that would preclude me from copying and renaming it IT3_reduced_cellParams.pkl? *DID THIS IN ~/Desktop/cells*
**** Midpoint of L3 is 555 (160-950) and midpoint of L1 is 50 --> L = 505
**** cd ~/Desktop/cells; python; import cell_save; cell_save.geom('IT3_reduced',505)
**** IT3_reduced_cellParams.pkl --> IT3_reduced_new.pkl
*** L5 pyramidal L/XL --> IT5A, IT5B, PT5B?? which one, which layer? 
** Pops that need to extend to L2 
*** 

** IN light of IT3 modifications (see previous point), I should change *netParams.py* as well, yes?

*** L4 spiny stellate needs to go from L4 --> L3 
*** L4 [1100; 950-1250] --> L3 [555; 160-950]
*** Length = 545 (1100-555) 
*** In ITS4.py, dend.L = self.rho * self.soma.L
**** self.rho = 165
**** self.soma.L = 10
**** To change length, (1) change rho (2) change soma.L (3) just set dend.L = 545
*** Tried to change dend.L in ITS4.py in ~/Desktop/cells, but having trouble with ca_ion. Loads fine in ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1 (python -i netParams.py), so I think it's something to do with the mod files. Changing it in the file here, not in temp dir on local desktop. --> works

** Make a git branch for this
*** git checkout -b cells
*** OR git branch cells; git checkout cells
** Cell editing continued:
*** Go to cells branch (=git checkout cells=) 
*** mkdir dend_edits; cd dend_edits
** Populating git branch:
*** Go to cells branch (=git checkout cells=) 
*** mkdir dend_edits; cd dend_edits
*** copied in all mod files; nrnivmodl (to compile) 
*** NOTE: see 9/17 entry for algorithm on changing dendrite lengths
*** Copied in (from ~/Desktop/cells --> where I was doing all the edits) the following cell files:
**** IT2_reduced
**** IT3_reduced
**** ITS4.py (spiny stellate)
**** IT4_reduced
**** IT5A_reduced
**** IT5B_reduced
**** PT5B_reduced 
**** IT6_reduced (goes to L5) 
**** CT6_reduced 
**** ITC6_reduced (goes to L1) 
*** Also put in netParams_OLD.py, netParams_NEW.py, overlay_ACTIVE.py, and overlay_PASSIVE.py for cell tuning (see below)
*** Also put in cell_batch.py, cfg.py, and init.py so that scripts listed above can have access to batch (needed for comparison)
*** Put in test_cell.py in order to do pre-comparison testing
*** git add and commit like usual (making sure on correct branch)
*** git push origin cells --> to push changes 
** Cell tuning algorithm:
*** (0) Change basics of 3 sets of scripts:
**** netParams_OLD.py and netParams_NEW.py (3 things for both, 1 extra in NEW):
***** (i) 'cellType' in netParams.popParams
***** (ii) label and (iii) fileName in cellRule (netParams.loadCellParamsRule)
***** *FOR NEW ONLY* (iv) netParams.cellParams[CELLNAME e.g. 'IT3_reduced'
**** overlay_PASSIVE.py and overlay_ACTIVE.py:
***** Make sure each overlay graph has the correct title (plt.title, at the end in plotting section) 
**** test_cell.py: change cellType, label, and fileName, along with netParams.cellParams[]
*** (1) Look at existing mechanisms:
**** cd .../A1/cells/dend_edits
**** In terminal: python
**** from netpyne import specs
**** netParams = specs.NetParams()
**** netParams.loadCellParamsRule(label='IT3_reduced', fileName='IT3_reduced_cellParams.pkl')
**** *EXPLORE PARAMS*: netParams.cellParams['IT3_reduced']['secs']['soma']['mechs']['mechs']
*** (2) Make a list of which mechanisms should be modified for passive and which for active
**** e.g. netParams.cellParams['IT3_reduced']['secs']['soma']['mechs']['pas']['g']
*** (3) Change netParams_NEW.py according to above findings:
**** Add in lines that will allow you to change param values: 
**** e.g. netParams.cellParams['IT3_reduced']['secs']['soma']['mechs']['pas']['g'] = placeholder_value
**** e.g. v_init sometimes too: 
***** netParams.cellParams['IT3_reduced']['globals']['v_init'] = -80 #-85.3
***** netParams.cellParams['IT3_reduced']['secs']['soma']['vinit'] = -80 #-85.3
*** (4) *PASSIVE FIT* 
**** Change things above
**** Delete (on FIRST iteration), data_old (or rename) --> will contain data from last cell fitted 
**** Run python -i overlay_PASSIVE.py 
**** save fig as cellName_ORIG_PASSIVE_FIT.png 
**** Adjust params iteratively in netParams_NEW.py until reasonable passive fit is achieved
****** May also test values in test_cell.py just to see what traces look like 
****** have to sometimes adjust v_init in test_cell.py for trace visualization 
*** (5) *ACTIVE FIT* 
**** use test_cell.py to find rheobase 
**** change current_steps in overlay_ACTIVE.py so first value is near rheobase
**** change params['amp'] in batch (if FitType == 'active':\ params['amp'] = [])
**** *on first iteration* : Delete data_old (there will be data from last cell in there bc batch doesn't overwrite data_old) 
**** run python -i overlay_ACTIVE.py 
**** look at original param values:
***** python; from netpyne import specs
***** netParams = specs.NetParams()
***** netParams.loadCellParamsRule(label='IT3_reduced', fileName='IT3_reduced_new_cellParams.pkl')
***** netParams.cellParams['IT3_reduced']['secs']['soma']['mechs'].keys()
***** netParams.cellParams['IT3_reduced']['secs']['soma']['mechs']['nax']
**** change values (up or down) in netParams_NEW.py (netParams.cellParams[]...)
**** save figures that you want to save
*** (6) Make traces
**** use test_cell.py with the new params
**** OR look in data_new / data_old directories 
** Save new cells in .pkl format: save_cell.py (in dend_edits) 
** Test ^^ new .pkl file in test_cell 
*** (may need to comment out del netParams.cellParams[...conds] if that's in there) 
** Transfer to cells directory and rename

I've tried   a bunch of stuff to figure it out but so far no headway -- can't find much on this error from previous slack chats or in github, at least not enough to crack the problem
samn 1:26 PM
iclamp is for the tuning?
ericaygriffith 1:26 PM
I saw a long time ago that you two had a similar issue and there was some kind of Mac-related conversation around this, but it wasn't the same exact error and I had trouble figuring out if it applied here
yeah, need to do IClamp for tuning
samn 1:27 PM
what's diff between the pkl files?
ericaygriffith 1:28 PM
I've tried looking at the line-by-line differences and it hasn't shed much light on why one would work and one wouldn't -- I had an IT4 file I was using that didn't work; I copied in an old IT4 from M1 and that worked -- when I did line-by-line comparison only difference was the ynorm values
but couldn't figure out why that would make such a big difference, but it does seem to
but again not sure if that's the root of the problem? maybe when changing ynorm an encoding issue happened? but can't tell why or how to fix it, or when it happens vs. when it doesn't?
just wondering if either of you had seen before -- I am going to keep plugging away but wanted to share the issue
I know there was some py2 vs py3 stuff with the pkl files, but again -- this error isn't happening for all of them, so I don't know if that's relevant or not
samn 1:30 PM
sections specified in same way for the two cell types?
ericaygriffith 1:30 PM
yeah they seem to be
same sections, secLists
etc.
samn 1:30 PM
error seemed to indicate that the section where you wanted to put the clamp doesn't exist, so defaults to soma
ericaygriffith 1:30 PM
right
but both of them, when I load w/ loadCellParamsRule have the same sections
samn 1:31 PM
so the difference is a pkl file with parameters or also py file differs?
ericaygriffith 1:32 PM
I don't have the .py file for a lot of these bc I started with the M1 .pkl files and have been working with those -- I see in M1detailed there is an ITcell.py but other than that, don't have any .py
we talked about this awhile ago and concluded it was okay to work with the .pkl files, iirc
are you able to get an IClamp stim working with both of those files above? if so, then maybe something on my end?
samn 1:33 PM
so pkl specifies geometry as well as params...
ericaygriffith 1:33 PM
y
samn 1:33 PM
i haven't used this feature...if i clone your repo do you have a run sequence i can try?
ericaygriffith 1:34 PM
I have a test_cell.py I'll attach here (I haven't added it to the repo bc just for testing this problem) -- let me attach here
samn 1:34 PM
ok
this is up to date? https://github.com/suny-downstate-medical-center/A1
ericaygriffith 1:35 PM
yeah should be, I'm working on cells branch

in A1/cells/dend_edits --> keeping these changes contained in that subdir for now
will clean that up when merging
sry if not convention to do the way I'm doing; i'm just doing what makes sense as I go along
samn 1:36 PM
np
salvadord 1:40 PM
I'll have a look in a sec
samn 1:40 PM
thx
salvadord 1:42 PM
Should be ok to work with pkl... maybe some minor err somewhere so cells not instantiated properly
ericaygriffith 1:42 PM
y seems like it -- some of the .pkl files work just fine, some don't. very hard to tell why, but guessing it's some detail that I haven't tracked down eyt
yet*
samn 1:42 PM
cloned repo and set to cells branch
can you save that test_cells.py file to neurosim?
ericaygriffith 1:43 PM
sure thing one sec
samn 1:44 PM
oh, i got it
nevermind
ericaygriffith 1:45 PM
great -- let me know if there are issues. the ones that have A1 in the .pkl name have the parameters tuned.
samn 1:46 PM
so you run with python3 -i test_cell.py ?
ericaygriffith 1:46 PM
so e.g. for me, IT2_A1_cellParams.pkl works, but IT5A_reduced_cellParams.pkl does not work
y locally that is what I do to test
samn 1:46 PM
and compile with mkmod or nrnivmodl?
ericaygriffith 1:46 PM
I just change the name in the loadCellParams line
nrnivmodl at the moment (was wondering if that was the problem but tested and didn't make a diff on my machine yesterday)
samn 1:47 PM
k
IT5B_reduced_cellParams.pkl - where is that?
ericaygriffith 1:51 PM
should be in A1/cells
samn 1:52 PM
so you do python3 -i cell_test.py A1/cells/IT5B_reduced_cellParams.pkl ?
what's command you use?
got error that couldn't find the file when i just ran python3 -i test.py
ericaygriffith 1:54 PM
something dumber, I change the line in test_cell.py (the netParams.loadCellParams line) to reflect the right .pkl file, then run "python -i test_cell.py" -- I know I should change so I can just enter the filename sry
I attached the test_cell.py file above
samn 1:56 PM
ok, i was running from A1 dir, have to specify full path to the pkl
i get same error
/u/samn/A1/test.py
ericaygriffith 1:56 PM
okay so not just me -- are you able to use cells/IT2_A1_cellParams.pkl without getting that error?
samn 1:56 PM
lms
yeah, that one works
ericaygriffith 1:59 PM
ok, so same issue... I went back to the M1 repo and grabbed that repo's IT5B_reduced_cellParams.pkl and it didn't work either, so I don't think it was something I did with A1 changes? I'm not sure though. I'm going to keep investigating.
samn 2:03 PM
ok, i'll take a look at the pkl files too
pickle.load gives ascii errors
suppose you use encoding='ASCII'
ericaygriffith 2:08 PM
so encoding I'm not sure -- I remember there was some py2 vs py3 encoding stuff that happened; I can look back in my nb to see if relevant
samn 2:08 PM
but that gives UnicodeDecodeError
ericaygriffith 2:08 PM
yes I remember that error
samn 2:09 PM
how'd you load the pkl files?
ericaygriffith 2:09 PM
I think i had to specify encoding... latin1 I think?
let me look to make sure
samn 2:09 PM
ok that worked
so the idea is to have it human-readable?
ericaygriffith 2:09 PM
also used 'bytes' at one point it seems
i personally don't care if human-readable or not, I was just trying to get them to load bc I wasn't familiar with their contents before, so was just checking them out
I'll defer to you guys with respect to encoding,e tc.
samn 2:10 PM
will try resaving and see if it works
ericaygriffith 2:11 PM
good idea -- I have been using .saveCellParamsRule in netpyne to re-save after changes; looking for that function now on github to see if that has something to do with it potentially
samn 2:11 PM
didn't help
ericaygriffith 2:14 PM
:/ hm, okay -- what did you do to re-save? out of curiosity
samn 2:14 PM
ok, so they both have same sections...
pickle.dump(d5,open('cells/IT5B_new.pkl','wb'))
and geom
how'd you compare the dictionaries?
salvadord 2:17 PM
if run just python netParams.py should see if any specific errors loading or saving the pkl
ericaygriffith 2:18 PM
a few ways... saved them and compared with ==, turned some parts into lists and looked at line-by-line differences, things like that. I was trying a couple approaches to try to get at everything i could think of
yeah -- so, no errors loading or saving, I can load them okay
it's when I try to apply an IClamp that it says that there is no sec specified so default to soma, but then it does not default to soma and I get no trace
samn 2:18 PM
and can netpyne access the sections without the iclamp?
ericaygriffith 2:18 PM
but I can see the sections when I load that .pkl with loadCellParamsRule
what do you mean by access specifically
samn 2:19 PM
are they properly setup/represented
ericaygriffith 2:19 PM
like I can load the pkl files into netParams.cellParams['cellName'] and then see the ['secs'] and what not
I'll try anything else, sorry if I'm not understanding
salvadord 2:19 PM
not different to see the sections in netParams (high-level specs) vs in net.cells (instantiated)
samn 2:20 PM
so the sections exist
ericaygriffith 2:20 PM
oh hmm I haven't looked at that salva, let me see
samn 2:21 PM
btw, Nafcr is not part of the repo afaik - got error about vipcr_cell.hoc when run netParams.py
ericaygriffith 2:21 PM
oh really? I have it in my mods directory
samn 2:21 PM
so netParams and net.cells - those should exist even in the test file erica made?
ericaygriffith 2:21 PM
mod* sorry
samn 2:21 PM
i see netParams but no net object
sim.net ?
mod*?
ericaygriffith 2:22 PM
I meant that I have nafcr.mod in the mod subdir
samn 2:22 PM
ok, sim.net.cells
nafcr.mod - right, i see it there...
not sure how you're running net though, but that's separate issue
ericaygriffith 2:23 PM
oh I was just about to ask that lol
I assumed I had to run netParams.py so I did but then realized I wasn't sure from there; was in the midst of googling
salvadord 2:24 PM
looks like not properly instantiated — no secs

ericaygriffith 2:24 PM
open to instruction of course
how do I get to sim.net?
samn 2:24 PM
not properly instantiated, so problem found :slightly_smiling_face:
ok, i see it's empty too
you have sim object in your test file
so where'd that pkl file with the problem come from then?
or...is it correct but there's a problem reading it in netpyne
salvadord 2:25 PM
reason is that the ‘conds’ are loaded from pkl and not updated to match your test — i.e. only applied to ynorm: [0.667, 0.775]
Untitled 
In [7]: netParams.cellParams['IT5B_reduced']['conds']
Out[7]: {cellModel: 'HH_reduced', cellType: 'IT', ynorm: [0.667, 0.775]}


samn 2:27 PM
so ynorm is property of that cell class
and conds for stim target are on TestPop
salvadord 2:27 PM
can just add del netParams.cellParams['IT5B_reduced']['conds'] — now works
samn 2:28 PM
TestPop separate from IT5B_reduced
how does netpyne know IT5B_reduced == TestPop?
salvadord 2:28 PM
for each cellParams properties there are a set of rules (conds) to decide which cells these properties will be applied to
netParams.popParams['TestPop'] = {'cellType': 'IT', 'numCells': 1, 'cellModel': 'HH_reduced'}
ericaygriffith 2:29 PM
the cellModel and cellType link them together as far as I can tell
salvadord 2:29 PM
cells in testPop have the properties cellType and cellModel… exactly
samn 2:29 PM
HH_reduced
is HH_reduced mentioned in the pkl file?
ericaygriffith 2:29 PM
y, in pkl file it specifies cellModel is HH_reduced, so I put that in TestPop as well
pkl file specifies cellType and cellmodel
samn 2:30 PM
ic, so if there was > 1 HH_reduced type, it would apply to all of them
ericaygriffith 2:30 PM
but only if the cellType was the same as well
salvadord 2:30 PM
yeah
this method can be overkill for simple models… but allows for more flexibility when specifying properties of cells
ericaygriffith 2:31 PM
so salva, let me see if I get this -- I figured it was something to do with ynorm bc I was able to break my ITP4 cell by changing ynorm, but you're saying if I just get rid of ynorm in the .pkl files maybe I'll be able to fix this?
in 'conds'?
salvadord 2:32 PM
so this is to solve the specific cell_test.py script you mentioned above
ericaygriffith 2:32 PM
y, but at some point I need to have them in order to localize them in the layers right?
or maybe that can be done another way?
salvadord 2:33 PM
generally just need to remember when loading from pkl, the conds/rules are also loaded… so just check that the cellParams ‘conds’ match what you want to do — can still use ‘ynorm’ since needed in network
ericaygriffith 2:33 PM
okay I thought so....
I got to this point last night at least, which is encouraging that I was on the right track
but i still wasn't able to solve the problem; but now let me look again
I'm probably overthinking something
salvadord 2:34 PM
but in the single test cell script the cell had a y location outside 0.667-0.775, so the cell params didnt apply to it
ericaygriffith 2:34 PM
ohhhh, I see I see I see
so in pt3d you mean
pt3d conflict with ynorm?
wasn't sure how that worked bc of normalized vs. non-normalized
salvadord 2:34 PM
not pt3d… that separate… in cell[‘tags’][‘y’]
ericaygriffith 2:34 PM
oh tags
oh had no idea that was a thing
salvadord 2:35 PM
all cells have x,y,zy when instantiated
randomly placed in network

samn 2:35 PM
and ynorm and y were inconsistent even though in same pkl?
salvadord 2:36 PM
ynorm and y were consistent
the pkl just stored the high level specs, not the actual location once instantiated … that happens later
ericaygriffith 2:36 PM
so the high-level specs (ynorm and y) were in conflict w/ the actual instantiated location
samn 2:36 PM
and what set the actual instantiated location?
ericaygriffith 2:36 PM
?
y my next question as well
salvadord 2:37 PM
so the high-level specs doesn’t define the ynorm or y … just specified a condition saying “only cells that end being within 0.6-0.7 y loc should rececive these properties’
once network is instantiated (sim.net.createCells() ) … each cell gets assigned a random location within the network volume
network volume defined by netParams.sizeX, sizeY, sizeZ … and specific spatial constraints for populations can be specified in netParmas.popParams (eg. ynormRange: [0.3,0.4])
samn 2:39 PM
so the network volume didn't include those cell ynorm ranges?
or something in net was inconsistent so the cell wasn't created properly
salvadord 2:40 PM
yeah, but the single cell instantiate in the test_cell.py script happened to be outside that range
i.e. ‘ynorm’: 0.3984944342173416 not inside [0.6667, 0.775]
samn 2:40 PM
and netParams.py was used in that test file via specs.NetParams() ?
salvadord 2:41 PM
nope, had its own netParams
nothing inconsistent, workins as expected
ericaygriffith 2:41 PM
is there a reason it's so consistent? like, IT2 always works but IT5B doesn't -- if it's randomly placed, shouldn't it potentially work some of the time and some of the time no?
either way that is very helpful -- ty as always salva. let me digest this and drink some coffee and fix. ty!!
salvadord 2:43 PM
if you instantiate a single cell using same default randomization, will always be placed in same place — so it’s reproducible (so prob happens to match IT2 y range)
ericaygriffith 2:44 PM
ohh I see
makes sense -- ok great, I think I can piece together the solution from here! hopefully! will update
thank you!!
salvadord 2:44 PM
great!
samn 2:56 PM
thx!
** Conclusion for now I believe is just to add =del netParams.cellParams[cellName]['conds']= after the line where the .pkl file is loaded 
** This will at least enable you to fix the param tuning. Let them know that ynorm / actual instantiation of cell location is up for debate (can look at this later if have time).

***** netParams.popParams['CT5B'] =     {'cellType': 'CT',  'cellModel': 'HH_reduced',   'ynormRange': layer['5B'],   'density': 0.5*density[('A1','E')][5]}  # density is [5] because we are using same numbers for L5B and L6 for CT cells? 
***** did density as [5] because same as L6? see comment above?
*** Add CT5B_A1_cellParams.pkl to cells subdir 
**** Copied CT6_A1_cellParams.pkl and renamed to CT5B_A1_cellParams.pkl 
**** Tested in cells/dend_edits subdir to make sure it works 
**** no changes to geom -- is that okay? 
*** version control: 
**** git add, git commit, git push origin cells (from cells branch) 
**** 9390a28..4da8ffc  cells -> cells
** Add CT cells to L5A: 
*** netParams.version = 13
*** Added CT5A cells to netParams.py
**** Added to cellParamLabels = {...}
**** 'CT5A_A1': {'cellModel': 'HH_reduced', 'cellType': 'CT', 'ynorm': layer['5A']},
**** Added to netParams.popParams:
***** netParams.popParams['CT5A'] =     {'cellType': 'CT',  'cellModel': 'HH_reduced',   'ynormRange': layer['5A'],   'density': 0.5*density[('A1','E')][5]}  # density is [5] because we are using same numbers for L5A and L6 for CT cells? 
***** did density as [5] because same as L6? see comment above?
*** Add CT5A_A1_cellParams.pkl to cells subdir
**** (NOTE: untested)
**** copied CT6_A1_cellParams.pkl and renamed
**** did not change geom
** Fixed densities of E cells in L5A & L5B 
*** netParams.py version 14
*** in netParams.popParams section
*** Kept evenly distributed densities (i.e. netParams.popParams['CT5B'] = {... 'density': (1/3)*density[('A1','E')][4])}
** Added version info at the bottom of netParams.py (v14) 
** Added CT5A & CT5B to Epops in netParams.py (v14) 
** Compile new mod mechanisms for RE, TC, and HTC cells
*** When merged cells w/ salva branch (on cells branch -- described above), new mod files came with it
*** Re-compiled:
**** on cells branch, locally on laptop, cd ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1
**** rm -r mod/x86_64
**** rm x86_64
**** ln -s mod/x86_64 x86_64
**** cd mod
**** nrnivmodl
**** cd ..
*** output after nrnivmodl:

**** mod files I'm not sure about: 
***** libnrnmech.la
***** mod_func.c and mod_func.lo, but no mod_func.mod? 
***** nafcr.mod --> looks compiled; did I do this now, or was it like this beforehand??
***** special --> pretty sure this is used in neuron stuff, created by the software; not going to touch

**** Tried copying mod directory to desktop to see if it works there; don't know why nrnivmodl stops running part of the way through the directory, but it doesn't seem to make it past a certain point (stops due to some kind of error maybe?). Either way, "nrnivmodl <file.mod>" only puts that mechanism into 'special'; this is not a cumulative process. Doing "nrnivmodl <file1.mod> <file2.mod>" will put both file1 and fil2 into special, rendering both of those mechanisms usable. Have to figure out which mod files are causing the issue. 

*** ISSUE 1 FIXED:
**** Added the file aux_fun.inc to mod and re-compiled. This file was mentioned in all the errors listed above. 
**** Found this file on modeldb, from a paper from Sam (2011): https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel.cshtml?model=139421&file=/hpcdemo/aux_fun.inc#tabs-2
* <2019-11-10 Sun -- Get updated model to run locally>
** GOAL: Get network running locally (on my laptop) 
** NEED: CT5A_A1_weightNorm.pkl and CT5B_A1_weightNorm.pkl: 
*** Copied CT6_A1_weightNorm.pkl & re-named it for CT5A & CT5B
*** Put these files into A1/cells
** VERSION CONTROL:
*** Add aux_fun.inc in A1/mod
*** Add CT5A_A1_weightNorm.pkl and CT5B_A1_weightNorm.pkl 
* <2019-11-11 Mon -- TC/HTC cells>
** TC and HTC cells showing subthreshold oscillations 
*** Check to see if this was present before AND after mod file change to htc.mod
*** TC cells:
**** A1/cells/sTC.py
**** on local machine (laptop): cd ~/Desktop; mkdir TC_test
**** In TC_test, added py files: sTC.py, sTC_new.py, and test_cell.py
***** sTC.py gets the orig htc.mod
***** sTC_new.py gets the htc_new.mod (suffix modified to htc_new, see below), and class renamed to sTC_new 
**** In TC_test, added mod files: htc.mod (ORIG FILE), htc_new.mod, cadad.mod, HH2.mod, IT.mod, kl.mod, tia.mod
***** Changed suffix in htc_new.mod to htc_new
**** Created sTC_new.py, and inserted htc_new into soma 
**** Compile mod files in TC_test with nrnivmodl (success)
** Difference between orig and new sTC cells:
*** Changes to htc.mod file:
**** ORIG line 87: USEION h READ eh WRITE ih VALENCE 1
**** NEW  line 87: :USEION h READ eh WRITE ih VALENCE 1
**** ORIG: NONSPECIFIC_CURRENT ih (NOT PRESENT IN NEW)
**** NEW: RANGE eh (NOT PRESENT IN ORIG) 

** Salva merge cells w/ some of his edits, need to clean up some unnecessary files causing lots of unimportant differences in branches:
*** git rm -r cells/dend_edits 
*** git commit -m 'deleting dend_edits folder'
*** git rm -r cells/NGF_archived_files_and_figures
*** got rid of .pyc files as well in __pycache__ dirs throughout the repo

***** This is identical to Condition 4


*** NOTE: with the new htc.mod file, if I don't set anything, it sets eh_htc to 0, it seems? 
*** SO ^^, what if I try to set the old one to 0... will that make it oscillate? or maybe it can't because it's a range var in the new one, but not in the orig mod file?? 
**** can't seem to set it in test_cell.py or in sTC.py -- probably bc not range var, I'm guessing

*** CURRENT TC SETUP in A1 repo: 
**** mod file being used is htc_new.mod, suffix htc
**** in sTC.py, self.soma.eh is commented out
** htc.mod file now being used in A1 is the 'original' htc.mod (without the RANGE eh 'quick fix' made by salva and sam before SfN) --> except now, the USEION h line has been deleted.

* <2019-11-22 Fri -- thal interneuron model passive fitting>
** Set up optimization scripts
** 9/26/19 describes algorithm 
*** scripts were in dend_edits subdir -- now on local machine in archive/A1_archive --> unzip this directory
*** dang, this is empty -- go on github for prev version? 
*** went to github, found and copied in the following files to A1/cells/tINT:
**** overlay_ACTIVE.py, overlay_PASSIVE.py
**** netParams_OLD.py, netParams_NEW.py
**** test_cell.py 
** Algorithm:
*** netParams_OLD.py imports sTI_large.hoc
*** netParams_NEW.py imports sTI.hoc
*** Looked at params; the following should be modified in sTI.hoc:
**** PASSIVE:
***** soma 'cm'
***** soma Pass (from ntleak.mod): g_Pass or erev_Pass 
***** dend (if needed): cm, g_Pass, erev_Pass 
**** ACTIVE: 
***** CURRENTLY TBD
*** Added in lines corresponding to the above in netParams_NEW.py 
#netParams.cellParams['sTI_reduced']['secs']['soma']['geom']['cm'] = # ORIG: 1
#netParams.cellParams['sTI_reduced']['secs']['soma']['mechs']['Pass']['g'] = # ORIG: 18e-6
#netParams.cellParams['sTI_reduced']['secs']['soma']['mechs']['Pass']['erev'] =  # ORIG: -72.5
* <2019-11-26 Tue -- thal interneurom model active fitting>
** Added passive params (listed below) from fitting into sTI.hoc file
*** (in soma) g_Pass = 0.00015
*** (in soma) erev_Pass = -75
*** v_init set to -65 for both soma and dend; don't know how to initialize this in a hoc file, but luckily that is the default. won't experiment, for time's sake. 
** Active algorithm (described in 9/26 entry) 
*** Use test_int.py to find rheobase

**** what channel? doesn't say 
**** guessing it is fast sodium 
*** kdr2 --> kdr2.mod
**** what channel? doesn't say
**** guessing slow potassium? dr --> delayed rectifier? 
*** Pass --> leak, ntleak.mod

*** iahp --> Slow Ca2+-dependent K+ current (slow AHP), Iahp.mod
*** ican --> Slow Ca2+-dependent cation current, Ican.mod
*** iar --> Anomalous rectifier Ih (*this is HCN then?), ntlh.mod 
** Channels to adjust for bursting:
*** HCN:
**** iar (ntlh.mod) --> HCN -- anomalous rectifier Ih 
*** L-type:
**** *RECALL: L-type --> high-threshold Ca2+ current
**** ical (IL.mod)
**** ical2 (IL3.mod) 
*** T-type:
**** *RECALL: T-type --> LTS (low-threshold spikes) 
**** it2 (ntt.mod) 
** Adjusting T-type channels:
*** it2 (ntt.mod)
*** gcabar_it2 = 4.0e-4 (in sTI.hoc) 
*** gcabar = 0.024 (mho/cm2, in ntt.mod) 
** Adjusting Ican 
*** mechanism --> ican; Ican.mod

* <2019-12-05 Thu -- thal interneuron model>
** Tried inserting BK channel into soma (KC2) -- didn't help 
** looking at ntt.mod equations:
*** m_inf = 1 / (1 + e^[-(v+shift1+50)/4.8])
**** so if m is activation and m_inf is steady state probability of activation, then I want it to be more likely to activate at a higher voltage than it is now
**** right now, shift1 = 7 (or 10)
**** if shift1 = 7:
***** m_inf = 1 / (1 + e^[-(v + 57)/4.8])
***** meaning there's 0.5 chance of activation at v = -57mV 
***** there is ~100% chance of activation as v goes above -57mV 
***** there is ~0% chance of activation as v goes below -57mV 
*** h_inf = 1 / (1 + e^[(v+shift2+78) / 4.6])
**** so if shift2 = 0 like it does now
**** h_inf = 1 / (1 + e^[(v+78) / 4.6])
**** so if v = -78 --> h_inf = 0.5 chance of inactivation 
**** if v = -100 --> h_inf = closer to 1, as voltage decreases below -78
**** if v = +20 --> h_inf = closer to 0, as voltage increases above -78
*** I want "% inactivation" to move towards 0 as potential decreases --> or do I? 
*** I want "% activation" to move towards 1 as potential increases 
 
*** Now, what I want to change is for the % inactivation to go to 0 at a higher voltage than -78. 

*** figure out when they're ~0 and when they intersect to determine window current for these channels 
**** m_inf = ~0 when:
***** 0 = 1 / (1 + e^[-(v+shift1+50)/4.8])
***** epsilon = 1 / (1 + e^-x) --> epsilon * (1 + e^-x) = 1 --> 
***** epsilon + epsilon * (e^-x) = 1 --> epsilon * (e^-x) = ~1 --> 
***** e^-x = (1-epsilon) / epsilon --> -x = ~10 (8, 13, etc.)
***** x = -10 (ish)
***** (v + shift1 + 50) / 4.8 = -10 (ish) 
***** v + shift1 + 50 = -50 (ish)
***** v + shift1 = -100 (ish) --> this is when % activation is close to 0, when v = -100-shift1
**** when is % activation 0.5? --> when v + shift1 + 50 = 0 --> v + shift1 = -50 --> v = -50-shift1
**** when is % activation closer to 1? --> 
*****  m_inf = 1 / 1+e^-x --> when x gets very very large 
***** x = v+ shift1 + 50 --> let's say e^-10 = epsilon
***** (v + shift1 + 50) / 4.8 = 10 --> v + shift1 + 50 = 50 --> v + shift1 = 0 --> v = -shift1

** PROTOCOL:
*** Go back in github history and find the edited file
*** ^^ download this file
*** Go to #auditory on slack, and search for png of fitted cell
*** ^^ If this graph looks good, test it out to see if it's usable 
*** ^^ use ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1/test_depol.py to test comparison briefly 
*** If the graph is clearly not good enough, do overlay fitting (*see below). 
** OVERLAY FITTING PROCESS:
*** Basically, I need a setup where... I can....
**** load the cell I want to modify into some kind of testing setup
**** run a batch with the appropriate current inputs
**** an overlay script that can take the original fI curve info, extract the new fI curve info, and then superimpose info from the original onto the new info. 
**** Iteratively change netParams.py to change the fit of the cell. 
**** *QUESTIONS*: 
***** Where do I do this? Where do I put the files?
***** What can I recover from old attempts to do this? 
** [solved] MPI problems:
*** Added to ~/.tcshrc
**** # for MPIexec use      
setenv PATH /anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages:$PATH
**** commented out the above by now
*** I can see mpi4py in /anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages, but not in ~/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages, but having major malfunctions trying to add this to my path. 
*** Attempting install --> WORKED

* <2020-04-21 Tue -- IT cell tuning>
** git issue:
*** git reset --hard origin/erica
*** wasn't allowing me to add or commit 
** TUNING ALGORITHM:
*** (1) in batch_tune.py, change params['amp'] to the relevant current steps
*** (2) overlay.py, change the current_steps and data_firing_rates to the values corresponding to the correct cell type
*** (3) netParams.py --> change:
**** netParams.popParams line
**** netParams.loadCellParamsRule line
**** netParams.cellParams...['conds'] line
**** netParams.stimTargetParams line (last line, 'conds' pop) 
*** (4) run overlay.py (n number of times)
*** (5) Change values in netParams.py (at the end)
*** (6) store original data folder + figure 
*** (7) re-run overlay.py (n number of times) -- change values -- repeat
** ITP4 tuning 
*** USING FIT 8: gbar_nax = 0.08, gbar_kdr = 0.015
*** original [FITNESS = 609]
**** ITP4_A1_cellParams.json copied into cells/tuning, from /cells subdirectory 
**** *cells/tuning/batch_data_ITP4_orig* contains the unmodified traces + original fit figure. 
*** fit 1 [FITNESS = 1100]
**** increased gbar_nax to 0.06 and kdr_gbar to 0.009 
**** cells/tuning/batch_data_ITP4_1
*** fit 2 [FITNESS = 1035]
**** increase gbar_nax to 0.07
**** gbar_kdr = 0.009
*** fit 3 [FITNESS = 1043]
**** qualitatively looks a little better
**** increase gbar_nas to 0.08
**** gbar_kdr = 0.009
*** fit 4 [ FITNESS = 851 ] 
**** getting better! 
**** gbar_nax = 0.08
**** gbar_kdr = 0.01 
*** fit 5 [FITNESS = 750]

**** seeing if I can move that green trace up just a tad
**** gbar_nax = 0.085
**** gbar_kdr = 0.015 
*** fit 9 [FITNESS = 46] -- deleting this dir; made it worse!
**** gbar_nax = 0.08
**** gbar_kdr = 0.017
*** How to make the model trace now go up just a tad? --> *salva says M1 IT4 was approximation anyway, so OK to move to next cell pop*
**** samn says "could reduce a slower k channel"
**** K channels:
***** kdr -- already being modified
***** kBK -- kBK.mod ("large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (BK)")
***** kap -- kap_BS.mod (K-A channel) 
**** Salva says don't worry about it 
*** *NOTE*: 
**** format of saving was to rename the batch_data folder to batch_data_ITP4_fitNumber, copy-paste figs saved onto desktop regarding fI curve overlay. 
*** *NOTE*: ~/Desktop/ITP4.zip contains figs with fI curve overlay fitting 
*** SAVING:
**** in cells/tuning/netParams.py, I added layer info and a saving line that I commented out at the bottom (to be uncommented when saving)

* <2020-04-23 Thu -- TC cell fix>
** TC cell issues: 
*** Right now, TC cell fires after current injection stops. 
*** Need it to do both burst and tonic firing. 
*** As I recall, the mechanism governing bursting in these cells is being brought to hyperpolarized potentials, allowing the T channels to de-inactivate. 
*** So --> what to do next? 
**** I should set up testing script(s) for the TC cells. Meaning, in this case, that I should put them in test_depol.py 
**** I should also put in the HTC cells -- what is the diff again?? H channels... but what do they do? Should they be the same?  --> *look this up in auditory channel chat*
**** Then I should test them at a bunch of ranges. Hyperpolarize to see if they rebound burst, and depolarize to make sure they do appropriate tonic bursting. 
** Next steps:
*** *NOTE* -- .json vs. .py --> modify the .json, then explain to salva. 
*** (1) [done] Check to see what files exist on github repo for TC & HTC
**** A1/cells on erica branch:
***** sTC.py   --> used in A1/netParams_cell.py 
***** sHTC.py  --> used in A1/netParams_cell.py 
***** TC_reduced_cellParams.json  --> used in A1/netParams.py
***** HTC_reduced_cellParams.json --> used in A1/netParams.py
**** Looks like sTC.py and sHTC.py are first processed through A1/netParams_cell.py in order to produce a json file with all of the accoutrements. 
**** Then, (H)TC_reduced_cellParams.json gets used in A1/netParams.py 
**** So --> what is my strategy then? It will be to make my own A1/cells/tuning/netParams.py file do something similar in terms of saving re: netParams_cell.py
*** (2) [done] in A1/cells/tuning (on laptop), copy in TC and HTC cell json & py files from A1/cells
*** (3) [done] Change A1/cells/tuning/netParams.py to accommodate these files. 
*** (4) [done] Change test_depol.py for testing. 
*** (5) Start testing TC cells with A1/cells/test_depol.py
**** definitely keeps firing after depolarizing current injection is taken away
**** does burst in rebound response to -0.3nA --> sorta looks bursty at the beginning with stronger hyperpolarizing current inputs? but just keeps firing basically.

** Troubleshooting NGF cells:
*** I ran test_depol.py, and saw that it was firing already at 0.1nA, and that it didn't run into depol block even at 0.8 nA, but it did look like it was firing QUITE a lot. lots of adaptation as well. 
*** 1 --> What does it look like at 36C? 
**** about the same? 
*** 2 --> What does the fI curve look like? 
**** For this, I guess I have to run batch... so I have to (1) change the batch scripts to apply to NGF cells (2) Figure out how to use overlay.py to generate an fI curve. 
**** [DONE] How to modify overlay.py for this purpose? 
***** Expanded current steps so they go from 0.05nA to 0.60 nA
***** Expanded data_firing_rates so this is the same length as current_steps; made up arbitrary values for this because it won't be used
***** Commented out lines to append the last current step 
***** Commented out print(firing_rate_fitness) because I don't need to see that right now. 
***** In plotting:
****** (1) commented out the plot of current_steps vs. data_firing_rates, and only kept the plot for current_steps vs. model_firing_rates 
****** (2) ^^ same line, commented out the label for that plot
****** (3) I also commented out the text that displays the fitness value (not calculated here) 
****** (4) After getting an error, commented out the line plt.legend(loc='middle right')
**** [DONE] Modify A1/cells/tuning/batch_tune.py 
***** Changed params['amp'] to [0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.30, 0.40, 0.45, 0.50, 0.55, 0.60], so it matches current_steps in overlay.py 
**** [DONE] Modify A1/cells/tuning/netParams.py
***** load cell param rule (json, hoc)
***** pop params
***** stimSourceParams / stimTargetParams
***** Added commented-out-for-now change-params line
***** Added commented-out-for-now save json line

** ITS4 tuning -- *THIS IS FROM 10/04/2019 entry*: 
*** L4 spiny stellate with dend length 535 
*** load cell --> test_stellate.py
**** test_stellate.py loads and adds stim to the cell
**** netParams.importCellParams(label='ITS4_reduced', conds={'cellType':'ITS', 'cellModel':'HH_reduced'}, fileName = 'ITS4.py', cellName = 'ITS4_cell')
**** cellType: ITS, cellModel: HH_reduced, cellName = ITS4_cell, label = ITS4_reduced
**** in ITS4.py in *A1/cells/dend_edits* on cells branch on local machine, set soma_pas from False to True, and uncommented soma_pas lines in def initsoma (self): 
*** Changed the way I change the scripts (see above for cellType / cellModel details, etc.) Still using netParams_OLD.py, netParams_NEW.py, etc. 
*** PASSIVE: 
**** PARAMS: cm = 0.75,  e_pas = -70, g_pas = 1/3e4
**** PARAMS_NEW: cm = 0.75, e_pas = -70, g_pas = 3.79e-03
**** v_init --> -70.4 
*** ACTIVE: 
**** use test_stellate.py with ITS4_ORIG.py to find rheobase: ~0.054nA 
**** PARAMS: gmax_naz = 30000, kv_gbar = 1500
**** current_steps = [0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.10, 0.11] 
**** Mess with DENDRITE CONDUCTANCES:
***** DIDN'T WORK
**** okay -- so, basically... added another dendrite (dend1) attached at soma loc 0.3, 1000 in length. same electrophys as the original dendrite. changed soma conductances. changed rho to 53.5 
**** naz_gmax = 72000
**** kv_gbar = 1700 
*** ITS4.py changes:
**** soma.insert('km') vs. soma.insert('kv') in def initsoma(self) 
**** commented out soma.gbar_kv in def initsoma(self)
**** ^ UNDID THESE
**** added def initdend1() in case want to make another dendrite --> all lines commented out for now 
**** AN INCOMPLETE LIST !! -- see above in ACTIVE subsecton for more details
*** save modified ITS4.py 
** Cell tuning algorithm (for .pkl files) -- *THIS IS FROM 10/04/2019* below "ITS4 tuning" entry:
*** This is all taking place in A1/cells/dend_edits (on cells branch) 
*** (0) Change basics of 3 sets of scripts:
**** netParams_OLD.py and netParams_NEW.py (3-4 things for both, 1 extra in NEW):
***** (i) 'cellType' in netParams.popParams
***** (ii) label and (iii) fileName in cellRule (netParams.loadCellParamsRule)
***** *FOR NEW ONLY* (iv) netParams.cellParams[CELLNAME e.g. 'IT3_reduced'
***** NOW ALSO CHANGE del conds line!!! 
**** overlay_PASSIVE.py and overlay_ACTIVE.py:
***** Make sure each overlay graph has the correct title (plt.title, at the end in plotting section) 
**** test_cell.py: change cellType, label, and fileName, along with conds and  netParams.cellParams[]
*** (1) Look at existing mechanisms:
**** cd .../A1/cells/dend_edits
**** In terminal: python
**** from netpyne import specs
**** netParams = specs.NetParams()
**** netParams.loadCellParamsRule(label='IT3_reduced', fileName='IT3_reduced_cellParams.pkl')
**** *EXPLORE PARAMS*: netParams.cellParams['IT3_reduced']['secs']['soma']['mechs']['mechs']
**** PUT THESE IN COMMENTS In netParams_NEW.py and test_cell.py, for ref
*** (2) Make a list of which mechanisms should be modified for passive and which for active
**** e.g. netParams.cellParams['IT3_reduced']['secs']['soma']['mechs']['pas']['g']
*** (3) Change netParams_NEW.py according to above findings:
**** Add in lines that will allow you to change param values: 
**** e.g. netParams.cellParams['IT3_reduced']['secs']['soma']['mechs']['pas']['g'] = placeholder_value
**** e.g. v_init sometimes too: 
***** netParams.cellParams['IT3_reduced']['globals']['v_init'] = -80 #-85.3
***** netParams.cellParams['IT3_reduced']['secs']['soma']['vinit'] = -80 #-85.3
*** (4) *PASSIVE FIT* 
**** Change things above
**** Delete (on FIRST iteration), data_old (or rename) --> will contain data from last cell fitted 
**** Run python -i overlay_PASSIVE.py 
**** save fig as cellName_ORIG_PASSIVE_FIT.png 
**** Adjust params iteratively in netParams_NEW.py until reasonable passive fit is achieved
****** May also test values in test_cell.py just to see what traces look like 
****** have to sometimes adjust v_init in test_cell.py for trace visualization 
*** (5) *ACTIVE FIT* 
**** use test_cell.py to find rheobase on ORIGINAL cell file 
**** change current_steps in overlay_ACTIVE.py so first value is near rheobase
**** change params['amp'] in batch (if FitType == 'active':\ params['amp'] = [])
**** *on first iteration* : Delete data_old (there will be data from last cell in there bc batch doesn't overwrite data_old) 
**** run python -i overlay_ACTIVE.py 
**** look at original param values:
***** python; from netpyne import specs
***** netParams = specs.NetParams()
***** netParams.loadCellParamsRule(label='IT3_reduced', fileName='IT3_reduced_new_cellParams.pkl')
***** netParams.cellParams['IT3_reduced']['secs']['soma']['mechs'].keys()
***** netParams.cellParams['IT3_reduced']['secs']['soma']['mechs']['nax']
**** change values (up or down) in netParams_NEW.py (netParams.cellParams[]...)
**** save figures that you want to save
*** (6) Make traces
**** use test_cell.py with the new params
**** OR look in data_new / data_old directories 
*** Save new cells in .pkl format: save_cell.py (in dend_edits) 
*** Test ^^ new .pkl file in test_cell 
**** (may need to comment out del netParams.cellParams[...conds] if that's in there) 
*** Transfer to cells directory and rename
*** Do version control 
** LINKING ITS4 TUNING SCRIPTS TO SALVA:
*** mkdir ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1/cells/tuning/ITS4
*** copied in ITS4.py and ITS4_reduced_cellParams.json into this directory
*** copied in the mod files 
*** copy in batch scripts; modify one by one -- NOPE, STOPPING THIS:
**** looks like from earlier entries that I was working in cells/dend_edits -- don't know how to revive this branch, so... 
**** init.py

** TOMORROW: ADD IN PROGRESS TO NGF CELLS -- 
** TOMORROW -- ADD IN PROCESS FOR LOOKING AT OLD BRANCHES + DELETED FILES 
* <2020-05-09 Sat -- NGF fitting>
** (some steps accomplished yesterday on local machine)
** Looks like we took a VIP cell model (vipcr_cell.hoc *re-locate source of this*) and modified it -- had the adapting and high firing rate properties we were looking for)
*** which cell model; where was it from? SOURCE: *FIND THIS*
** Then I fit it to the data from that NGF monkey vs rat paper that I linked to in previous entries
** What scripts were used for fitting? From previous nb entries, I used a subdir called "NGF_optimization" 
** YES --> On 8/19/19, I made a copy of A1 at that point called A1_uncloned (had to change my repo structure -- for boring details see entry on 8/19/19). This means that A1/cells/NGF_optimization are the scripts I was using, but none of the edits made after 8/19/19. 
** ALSO --> ON 09/04/2019, I said: ** Added dend section to ngf_cell.hoc in ~/Desktop/NGF_tests/NGF_overlay_ACTIVE/ngf_cell.hoc. <-- Meaning, NGF_tests is the relevant testing directory for local edits.** Added scripts for passive and active fitting to repo:
*** *NGF_PASSIVE* and *NGF_ACTIVE*
*** ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1/cells/tuning/NGF_PASSIVE --> comes from ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/archive/A1_archive/NGF_archived_files_and_figures/NGF_tests/NGF_overlay
*** ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1/cells/tuning/NGF_ACTIVE --> comes from ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/archive/A1_archive/NGF_archived_files_and_figures/NGF_tests/NGF_overlay_ACTIVE
** TO DO: add in fitness functions on adaptation ratio and instantaneous frequency, etc. from the other evol scripts.
* <2020-05-10 Sun -- NGF fitting>
** Yesterday I created a directory NGF_sandbox (~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1/cells/tuning/NGF_sandbox) that contains NGF_optimization and a couple of other NGF fitting data folders 
** Looks like around 8/27/19 I started fitting NGF 
*** Didn't spell out my exact process, but looks like this is where it started
** TO DO: Take a look at the active scripts ---> grab new fitness functions from other evol scripts
*** which other evol scripts? I know I had some for adaptation 
*** Well, what are the data we have access to here --> 
**** (1) Adaptation Ratio:
***** AR = 1st interspike interval / last interspike interval
**** (2) Onset frequency (Hz):
***** "Calculated at the first interspike interval"
***** What is the equation then? 1/ISI_0 (inverse of the first ISI)
**** (3) Steady State Frequency (Hz): 
***** Average instantaneous frequency within the last 200ms of the response to depolarizing current pulses where firing frequency remained relatively stable
** PASSIVE fitting:
*** Same as the usual fitting situation --> you run mpiexec on overlay.py. 
*** 
TO DO: 
*** Take a look at either of the overlay scripts to see what the deal is
***** start with passive: ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1/cells/tuning/NGF_PASSIVE
*** Active fitting: 
**** ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1/cells/tuning/NGF_ACTIVE

salvadord(opens in new tab)  7:04 PM
I’m running in parallel the same evol but with cell density at 50%
7:05
when I run small-scale sims (eg. 5%) to test on laptop most pops are firing ok
7:05
so Im thinking maybe issue is with the scaling up of network
7:06
related to the scaling approach of paper we just submitted to Neu Comp … here the weights are reduced by the square of the scaling factor when resizing net — https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03764.pdf

samn(opens in new tab)  9:57 PM
50 prct so would have smaller net available later on?

samn(opens in new tab)  10:05 PM
^2 of scaling factor, ic, makes sense in general ... though sometimes hard to get desired dynamics if connectivity is probabilistic (some small imbalance could lead to hyperexcitability) . . . wonder if in that approach you used any adjustments around scaling factors
10:05
@issue - what is the current issue? NGF firing too high or some pops not at all?

salvadord(opens in new tab)  10:27 AM
smaller net avail - yeah … that takes <10 min on 96 cores
10:28
small imbalance lead to hyperexc - yeah that’s what seems to be happening in A1
10:28
issues - no solution where all pops fire reasonably
10:29
mosts solutions show very high NGF and ITS4, and several pops (IT2, IT3, etc) not firing at all

ericaygriffith(opens in new tab)  10:29 AM
can you explain more what you mean by imbalance?
10:30
want to make sure I'm thinking about this the same way you guys are

samn(opens in new tab)  10:31 AM
small differences in connectivity could lead to excitatory neurons activating just a bit too much which then propagates in the network out of control
10:31
e.g. if due to random conn one or a couple of E neuron has less intenreuron input

ericaygriffith(opens in new tab)  10:31 AM
so, there's some kind of small baseline "bias" towards excitatory activity that gets amplified as we scale up the network?

samn(opens in new tab)  10:32 AM
could happen at any scale but if you have stability at one scale and then adjust based on a formula, maybe on average youd get good results
10:32
but once in a while variability leads to amplification of activity
10:33
adjust params based on a formula and apply to another scale, that is
10:33
but interesting to see if it's more likely at diff scales

ericaygriffith(opens in new tab)  10:33 AM
okay thanks! what are strategies for dealing with this then...? would it be worth going over the connectivity again? I mean, looking at the raw numbers probably too opaque given all the complex interactions that happen, but maybe... is there some way to see at what size network we start to see this hyperexcitation? what kinds of metrics can we look at to see where it could be coming from or when it becomes a problem?

samn(opens in new tab)  10:34 AM
network params are probably all good and based on the data, but may have to tweak weights slightly

ericaygriffith(opens in new tab)  10:34 AM
also, what params get adjusted specifically, and what formula do we use for that? sorry if I should know this already

samn(opens in new tab)  10:34 AM
i was just guessing based on paper sal posted above

ericaygriffith(opens in new tab)  10:34 AM
or sorry if this is something I do know, but just not recognizing it from the wording

samn(opens in new tab)  10:35 AM
but you could have fixed convergence vs probability of connectivity

ericaygriffith(opens in new tab)  10:35 AM
oh didn't see that link from last night! missed that somehow -- looking now

samn(opens in new tab)  10:35 AM
np
10:35
fixed convergence prevents variable # of inputs so that's one way to ensure balanced E and I inputs

salvadord(opens in new tab)  10:37 AM
I also think of it in terms of: we have found conn probs and weights for each projection from many different sources etc.  when put all together and using an arbitrary network size (12k neurons) it may easily turn out that a particular population/cell type is receiving much more exc than inh … so that why need this high-level param tuning to adjust EE EI IE II weights to balance it out… of course when have >40 pops interacting with each other, this is not trivial and that’s what we are seeing
:+1:

ericaygriffith(opens in new tab)  10:37 AM
ah yes
10:37
that makes a lot of sense yeah

samn(opens in new tab)  10:38 AM
particular population - so maybe could measure E/I balance per population and see how to tweak

salvadord(opens in new tab)  10:38 AM
fixed convergence - yeah makes sense, but sometimes hard to get those numbers

samn(opens in new tab)  10:38 AM
suppose E/I balance measured from simulation when get the rates
10:38
but some directed search might help (?), ballsd? :slightly_smiling_face:

salvadord(opens in new tab)  10:39 AM
E/I balance per pop - yeah, makes sense … hopefully we can get closer to a solution with the evols that are running, and then can finetune

samn(opens in new tab)  10:39 AM
sg
New
10:41
these are interesting general issues for building these models though...

* <2020-05-20 Wed -- CSD function>
** INSTRUCTIONS ON CONTRIBUTING TO NETPYNE: https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/netpyne/blob/development/CONTRIBUTING.md
** samn sent (over #auditory channel on slack) a csd.py script that has functions which extract csd information from lfp data
** salvadord said (in DM) that it should ideally be integrated into netpyne analysis
*** e.g. lfp.py: https://github.com/NathanKlineInstitute/OEvent/blob/master/csd.py

** [DONE] Now go back to step 10 in "PROCESS OF CONTRIBUTING TO NetPyNE" and create a pull request as instructed.
*** steps are in (10) above
*** Pull request is #492 -- hopefully works! I let salva know. 
*** https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/netpyne/pull/492
** BASIC STEPS FROM HERE ON OUT:
*** on local machine, make sure I'm in branch "csd" (git branch / git checkout csd)
*** make changes
*** git status, git add file, git commit -m 'message'
*** git status to check, git branch to check
*** git push origin csd 
*** submit pull request (see above points for details) 
** QUESTION, ASK SALVA --> If salva doesn't close the pull request before I make and add/commit/push new changes to my fork, do I have to make another pull request, or will the new changes somehow get incorporated into any existing, open pull requests? 
** EXAMPLE NETPYNE LFP DATA FOR DEBUGGING: 
*** salva says "may need to compile mod files"
*** lfp from small net: https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/netpyne/blob/development/examples/LFPrecording/net_lfp.py
*** lfp from single cell: https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/netpyne/blob/development/examples/LFPrecording/cell_lfp.py
*** Tutorial 9 is about recording & plotting LFPs and references the above scripts: http://www.netpyne.org/tutorial.html#recording-and-plotting-lfps-tutorial-9
** there is another csd.py in netpyne:
*** ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/netpyne/netpyne/support/csd.py
*** author is samn!
*** "current source density approximation using second spatial derivative of local field potential"
** INFO ON CSD: http://www.neuroinf.pl/Members/danek/homepage/preprints/Article.2013-12-16.4021/getFile
*** also saved on my local machine (CSD_analysis.pdf)
** CSD functions in csd.py
*** https://github.com/NathanKlineInstitute/OEvent/blob/master/csd.py
*** def getlowpass (lfps,sampr,maxf)
**** lowpass-filter the items in lfps (lfps should be a list or numpy array of LFPs arranged spatially by column)
**** this should filter out the higher-frequency elements 
**** ^^ should maxf be 500 Hz by default? 
**** what is sampr?? 
***** looks like corresponds to "df" in functions like bandpass in module filter
***** https://github.com/NathanKlineInstitute/OEvent/blob/7bbaa15d7efc7f1333a3f41b0ba0918ca3d60400/filter.py#L44
***** param df: Sampling rate in Hz
***** ^^ is this the sampling rate of the recording device??
*** def getbandpass (lfps,sampr,minf=0.05,maxf=300)
**** bandpasses the lfp data
**** looks like min and max frequencies (lower & upper bounds of frequency band) are 0.05 - 300 Hz
**** again --> what is sampr? sample rate? what does this mean? 
*** def Vaknin (x)
**** (1) WHAT IS MS IMPLEMENTATION? 
***** # Vaknin correction for CSD analysis (MS implementation)
**** (2) WHAT CONTACTS?
***** # Allows CSD to be performed on all N contacts instead of N-2 contacts
**** (3) DOWNLOAD VAKNIN '89 PAPER
***** # See Vaknin et al (1989) for more details --> *actually Vaknin 88*
***** "A method for calculating current source density (CSD) analysis without resorting to recording sites outside the sampling volume." 
* <2020-05-24 Sun -- CSD function(s)>
** LFP tutorial results in LFP data
*** NOTE: I am on *development* branch (switched from csd with git checkout development)
*** cell_lfp.py:
**** https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/netpyne/blob/development/examples/LFPrecording/cell_lfp.py OR in netpyne/examples/LFPrecording/cell_lfp.py
**** Ran this script 
***** cd ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/netpyne/examples/LFPrecording
***** compiled mod files (see below) 
***** python -i cell_lfp.py 
**** To set up LFP recording, electrode placement: simConfig.recordLFP = [[x, y, 35] for y in range(280, 1000, 150) for x in [30, 90]]
***** this gives you --> (30, 280) (90, 280) ; (30, 430) (90, 430) ; ... ; (30, 880) (90, 880) 
**** what is the output? 
***** I get 3 plots:
****** Figure 1 is the voltage trace (simConfig.recordTraces --> simConfig.analysis['plotTraces']
****** Figure 2 is the LFP recording from each electrode
****** Figure 3 is a diagram, it appears, of the electrodes placed onto the cell model --> 
*** net_lfp.py: https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/netpyne/blob/development/examples/LFPrecording/net_lfp.py
**** netpyne/examples/LFPrecording/net_lfp.py
*** compiled mod files:
**** cd ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/netpyne/examples/LFPrecording
**** ln -s mod/x86_64 x86_64
**** cd mod
**** nrnivmodl 
** To add CSD functions to analysis capabilities, add them into netpyne/analysis/__init__.py --> 
*** # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Import CSD-related functions
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from .csd import getCSD
 
*** add these changes to fork 
** CHANGED NETPYNE LOCATION:
*** couldn't find csd functions in cfg no matter what I did!!
*** realized I was using original netpyne install --> 
*** pip uninstall netpyne
*** cd ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/netpyne --> git checkout csd --> pip install -e .
** Resolving netpyne errors:
*** On command line: python --> from netpyne import specs, sim --> resolving errors!!
**** (1) SyntaxError: from __future__ imports must occur at the beginning of the file
***** moved them so they come at the beginning, even though they already did...? might have been the comments at the beginning of the file??
**** (2)  ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'filter'
***** this is where the functions lowpass and bandpass come from --> these are located in netpyne/netpyne/support/filter.py 
***** I tried doing from ../support/filter import lowpass, bandpass --> did not work!!
***** copy-pasted filter.py from netpyne/netpyne/support to netpyne/netpyne/analysis --> have not added it into version control... maybe need to consolidate filter.py and csd.py into single script? 
**** FIX TO (2) --> tried adding from .filter import functions, but didn't work, tried a couple of other things, but the only things that worked were commenting out @exception before def getCSD() and crucially: in imports for csd.py I did from .filter import lowpass, bandpass (previously was from filter import lowpass, bandpass)
***** relative vs. absolute imports: https://realpython.com/absolute-vs-relative-python-imports/
**** commented out @exception, even though is present in several other scripts (from line before def getCSD)
** Took out line from the end of __init__.py that added in filter functions, because they were imported from filter.py, which was copy-pasted from netpyne/netpyne/support/filter.py to make the functions lowpass, bandpass, etc. available for csd.py 
** Still not able to use simConfig.analysis['getCSD'] --> commenting out everything and adding only the tiniest testing function at the beginning of csd.py so I can at least figure out how to get this hooked into netpyne 
** Adding to PYTHONPATH: setenv PYTHONPATH ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/netpyne/netpyne
** ^^ FIXED --> see convo with salva below: 
*** ADD IN CONVO DM WITH SALVA
** Now, uncomment the code from before, for testing --> change cell_lfp.py to reflect this
*** simConfig.analysis['getCSD'] = True <-- this was fine for testing, when just using a print statement to test that the fx integrated correctly 
*** now change this to reflect getCSD arguments in csd.py --> *simConfig.analysis['getCSD'] = {'lfps': True, 'sampr': simConfig.recordStep, 'spacing_um': 150}*
* <2020-05-25 Mon -- CSD>
** adding CSD data to sim.allSimData['CSD']
** Added filter.py to my fork for now (committed and pushed), but maybe not for long --> may wrap the functions from here into functions in csd.py 
** adding def plotCSD(): to functions in csd.py
*** adding import from .utils to include _showFigure and _saveFigData because imagine this will become relevant. 
*** add plotCSD to last line in __init__.py in netpyne/netpyne/analysis 
**** now the line reads from .csd import getCSD, plotCSD
** getCSD()
*** taking out the arguments for lfps = True or False; will just determine based on whether or not sim.allSimData['LFP'] exists. 
*** slicing subarrays:https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/02.02-the-basics-of-numpy-arrays.html
Array Slicing: Accessing Subarrays¶
Just as we can use square brackets to access individual array elements, we can also use them to access subarrays with the slice notation, marked by the colon (:) character. The NumPy slicing syntax follows that of the standard Python list; to access a slice of an array x, use this:

x[start:stop:step]
If any of these are unspecified, they default to the values start=0, stop=size of dimension,
step=1. We'll take a look at accessing sub-arrays in one dimension and in multiple dimensions.
*** ^^ so, to the above point, when getting the lfp values, this is the process that's occurring. turn the LFP data list in sim.allSimData into a numpy array, then slice it as [0:end-of-time-range/record-step:1] --> meaning, get LFP at every recorded time step. 
** comments taken out, from sam:
*** in Bandpass filter:
**** "Bandpass filter the items in lfps. lfps is a list or numpy array of LFPs arranged spatially by column"
*** in getCSD: Before the line "if vaknin: datband = Vaknin(datband):
 # # can change to run Vaknin on bandpass filtered LFPs before calculating CSD, that
  # # way would have same number of channels in CSD and LFP (but not critical, and would take more RAM);
  # # also might want to subtract mean of each channel before calculating the diff(diff) ?** COLORS FOR CSD PLOT: 
*** IN comment from sam in csd.py: # when drawing CSD make sure that negative values (depolarizing intracellular current) drawn in red, and positive values (hyperpolarizing intracellular current) drawn in blue."
* <2020-05-26 Tue -- plotCSD()>
** Adding params to plotCSD():
*** timeRange = None
*** saveData = None
*** saveFig = None
*** showFig = True
*** ^^ added documentation for these, in style of def plotLFP() in lfp.py 
** graph.py from samn (DM):
*** he says "not all the code's relevant, just the spline/interpolation parts"

** merged salva's branch into mine
*** git checkout erica 
*** did all adds/commits, etc. 
*** git merge salva 
*** --> got a message about how I needed a commit message, so closed terminal, re-opened, navigated back to correct dir
*** git commit -m 'merging salva branch into erica branch'
*** git push 
** TRYING CSD ON NETWORK:
*** CHANGE 1: in A1/cfg.py --> adding in line 83, cfg.analysis['getCSD'] = {'timeRange':[0,200],'vaknin':True}
*** CHANGE 2: in A1/init.py --> added last line to read sim.analysis.plotCSD()
*** CHANGE 3: *temporary change* --> changed duration of sim (in cfg.py) to 0.5*1e3 just to make it a little faster. 
** Change to netpyne/analysis/csd.py --> needed to comment out spacing_um lines that come too late, during plotting step (TO DO: add & commit this) 
** Also continuing to work on cell model descriptions. 
* <2020-06-20 Sat -- network csd + work on paper>

* <2020-06-24 Wed -- network csd>
** I am doing all of this in 'erica' branch of A1 
** Test CSD on whole network with better activity:
*** Turn on IC: 
**** salvadord: to turn on IC just set in cfg.py: cfg.ICThalInput = {'file': 'data/ICoutput/ICoutput_CF_9600_10400_wav_01_ba_peter.mat', 'startTime': 500, 'weightE': 0.5, 'weightI': 0.5, 'probE': 0.12, 'probI': 0.26}

*** ERP-like stimulation: 
**** samn: 
could look at somewhat strong thalamocortical input
or a brief tone
latter prob makes mose sense
that way could compare to the experimental data
**** salvadord: 
can just turn on the IC input
**** samn: for the ERP don't think they record those sound inputs but could simulate it as a click or sin wave ... or just white noise probably good. cochlear/IC model should allow setting amplitude - 50 dB is often used
*** BBN emails
**** sam forwarded them to my gmail
**** subj line: "Fwd: analysis of BBN responses across the tonotopic axis of A1"
** Modifications to network scripts based on above:
*** in cfg.py: turned on cfg.ICThalInput
**** changed from 'False' to {'file': 'data/ICoutput/ICoutput_CF_9600_10400_wav_01_ba_peter.mat', 'startTime': 500, 'weightE': 0.5, 'weightI': 0.5, 'probE': 0.12, 'probI': 0.26} 
*** Changed EEGain, EIGain, IELayerGain, IILayerGain, etc.
**** Added in values from best ASD cand
**** Added (though commented out right now) values in for best evol candidate
***** These appear to be what is currently in the network, hm!
*** QUESTIONS:
**** in cfg.py, do I have to turn on cochlearThalInput as well? *Leaving this as 0 for the first run* <-- seems this will provide the 50dB situation sam was mentioning. 
** Try running the model with the above modifications
*** cd ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1
*** python -i init.py
*** raster was quite sparse until the end. re-running with cfg.cochlearThalInput
* <2020-06-25 Thu -- csd on network>
** LFP was blank yesterday -- salva says this was a bug with recordLFP when recordStep was less than 1, due to an int / float situation. 
** To resolve, am updating to latest netpyne development branch:
*** cd ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/netpyne
*** git branch 
*** git checkout development 
*** git pull upstream development
**** This pulls changes from upstream/development (so development branch of neurosim netpyne github)
**** some people would do git pull --rebase upstream development, which does git fetch, then git rebase
**** git pull does git fetch, then git merge. This is evidently safer but not as clean. 
*** git push origin development
**** This pushes the changes that were just pulled into my cloned forked repo
*** git checkout csd
**** switch to feature branch
*** git merge development
**** merge in changes from the dev branch 
*** fixed merge conflict
**** conflict is in netpyne/analysis/__init__.py

** Changing A1/cfg.py to accommodate the values listed above. See 6/24/2020 for more detailed info. 
** Made changes to cfg.py 
** NOTE: checked in with sam and he asked if the recording electrode setup (in the sim) could be 23 electrodes with 100 micron spacing, to mimic the experimental setup. 
*** cfg.recordLFP is what I'll have to change I believe
*** ORIGINAL: cfg.recordLFP = [[100, y, 100] for y in range(0, 2000, 400)]
**** this gives us [[100, 0, 100], [100, 400, 100], [100, 800, 100], [100, 1200, 100], [100, 1600, 100]]
**** so I want 23 electrodes, and I want them to be spaced 100 microns apart. Meaning 0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, ..., 2200.

** Computer housekeeping tasks:
*** Have to update neuron for reproducibility issues -- *on laptop*
*** [DONE] Have to set up 2-step auth for neurosim servers
*** Have to set up vpn for NKI -- *have to upgrade mac os x*
** csd fig manipulation:
*** Where is the csd data stored? Anywhere external? (e.g. .json file?) 
*** Where is the csd data stored in terms of sim? (e.g. sim.allSimData)

**** install mac os x high sierra 
*** upgrade neuron on laptop
**** Do this after os upgrade
**** pip? 
**** what constants change? 
*** work on neurosim for csd fig
** CSD fig on neurosim --> *later*

** Changes to getCSD():
*** salva's suggestions:
**** 1. for arguments please use camelCase for consistency (should’ve done underscore but now too late to change all) … for internal variables in func, not critical to change
**** 2. can remove CSD_exists and just check if CSD_data is not None, in which case read that data
***** removing CSD_exists from plotCSD() arguments 
***** documentation:
      CSD_exists : bool
        Indicates if you are inputting arbitrary CSD data 
        ``True`` indicates that CSD data will be passed in as arbitrary input via CSD_data
        ``False`` assumes that CSD data must be derived using getCSD()
        **Default:**
        ``False`` 

**** 3. for layers in general we’ve used 1,2,3 etc in netpyne (instead of I, II, III), so maybe can change for consistency
**** 4. blank lines  - within a func we’ve tried to use 1 blank line to separate code blocks, and 2 blank to separate major code sections … kind of arbitrary and nothign strict about it, but good if can change that
**** 5. indentation - we use 4-spaced tabs (encoded as spaces not tabs) 
**** "that’s it, all minor things… will let u know if see anythign else"

** Removing LFP_exists similarly to how removed CSD_exists
*** documentation for this arg in getCSD():
      LFP_exists : bool
        "True" means that the user will input the lfp data as either a .json file from a netpyne simulation (into LFP_input_file), 
        or as a list / np array of LFP values (mV) (into LFP_input_data)
        **Default:**
        ``False``
** timeRange:
*** Generally speaking, the strategy for an ongoing simulation will be:
**** have plotLFP in there by necessity
**** exceptions to handle if LFP was not done -- can add in capability later to make this happen automatically if needed
**** use plotLFP's timeRange by default

* <2020-07-24 Fri -- high-firing rate offenders>
** *reminder to use asana**
** NGF & ITS4 are the biggest offenders
** See slack chat for more info 
*** so just to summarize - after lunch then, I'm going to plot the ITS4 firing rate correlation plots from the stuff salva posted above, and keep tuning ITS4 to lowered FI curve.
*** also on the agenda: look at the geometry of the problematic cells + strategize about NGF (potentially also tune to lowered FI curve) + look at VIP firing rate to see why depol block apparent in network (bc think FI curve looked reasonable? but will go back to look at that) 
** (1) plot ITS4 firing rate correlation plots
*** Assigned this to myself on asana
*** Info on the *code* for this:
**** https://github.com/NathanKlineInstitute/A1/blob/salva/analysis/optunaAnalysis.py#L104
**** pushed analysis code to ‘salva’ branch
*** *Code* is located on salva branch of A1, in A1/analysis/optunaAnalysis.py --> function defined in there called "plotScatterPopVsParams"
*** Access this *code*:
**** (a) could switch to salva branch and just do it from there. 
**** (b) try to merge this code into my branch. 
**** Going to try (b) -- see 11/07/2019 entry for another git merge example, and also this https://dev.to/neshaz/how-to-use-git-merge-the-correctway-25pd
**** so, (1) git add/commit etc on erica branch
**** (2) git checkout salva
**** (3) git pull (to get latest salva changes -- ensure it needs this by first doing git checkout salva and seeing if optunaAnalysis.py is in A1/analysis)

**** (ii) Enter those params into cfg.py
***** QUESTION: cfg.ICThalInput = False ? <-- will this work? probably yes?
***** (a) From salva: "I think commented out, ‘None’ and ‘False’ should all have same effect"
***** (b) From salva: another thing you can do if want to run batch with and without ICthalinput is keep all the dict info but set the Eprob and Iprob to 0.0

***** ^^ *OUTPUT* to this for many cell types has 'dend_all' <-- where does this come from? 
*** Correct ITS4 so that secLists includes 'dend_all'
**** Was something not done to this cell to make this happen? hm. 
**** Check on salva's branch as well 
** ITS4 potential issue:
*** On March 2, salva noted that ITS4 started spiking immediately with no input, and also stated that it caused lots of NGF spiking 
*** He set v_init to -75 to correct this issue, and we moved on. 
*** THIS IS PROBABLY THE PROBLEM!!!!! TEST ITS4!!!
** ITS4 testing:
*** ISSUES: 
**** (1) See above point about spiking with no input
***** (a) test different v_inits
**** (2) See about dend_all
***** (a) need to run this through netParams_cell.py ? 
*** Go to A1/cells/tuning/37C_fits/
*** mkdir ITS4 within this directory 
*** Put in ITS4.py and ITS4_reduced_cellParams.json FROM /A1/cells (erica branch)
*** Put in the relevant mod files 
**** cadad.mod
**** kca.mod
**** km.mod
**** kv.mod
**** naz.mod
**** Nca.mod
*** Compile mod files with nrnivmodl
*** Put in testing file (test_stellate.py) --> modify to make sure suitable 
*** *NOTE* If need to change vinit --> 
**** cfg.hParams in test_stellate.py
**** netParams.cellParams['..']['vinit'] in test_stellate.py
**** h.v_init in ITS4.py 
**** *CHECK JSON* 
*** Start testing
**** Start with loading from ITS4.py (check .json later)
**** Error: LookupError: 'v_init' is not a defined hoc variable name.
**** ^^ To deal with this, I commented out h.v_init in ITS4.py (hm) --> could set this in cfg.hParams['v_init'] later? 
**** When input just going to soma, not seeing any issues
**** (1) Compare when importing from .json vs. .py (not much diff) 
***** v_init established in .json?
***** are params the same? does anything accidentally set off todefault() in the process of saving the .json? 
**** (2) Add input along dendrites to see what happens  -- not much diff
** THOUGHTS ON ITS4:
*** (1) No secLists in dictionary means that anytime there was an input that didn't go to 'soma' that it wasn't actually receiving this input, potentially! So it was getting excitatory thalamocortical input to soma, but receiving essentially no inhibition --> *not quite true* --> *netpyne defaults to using soma if try to use an invalid sec for input* --> this means that it *was getting all of its E->E input into soma, as well as TC input to soma* --> *was also getting I input to soma though*
*** (2) There is the thing from March (described above), where a single spike was given off in the context of the network, causing the NGF cells to spike a lot, even with no input. I am having trouble replicating this! Not sure what is going on there, or how to recreate this. 
** *DONE* Change ITS4 to have dend_all in secList key
*** ah, I see why the secLists never got added -- simple ruleLabel mistake in netParams_cell.py saving block (ruleLabel is 'ITS4_reduced', but the if statement is searching for 'ITS4', so never got added) --> *changed this netParams_cell.py* 
*** Made a file called save_stellate.py on local machine in A1/cells/tuning/37C_fits/ITS4
*** Try using save_stellate.py to save .json from .py file: 
**** Uncomment lines under "IMPORT FROM .PY FILE"
**** Comment out lines for importing from .json file 
**** addWeightNorm, addSecLists, and add3DGeom all set to True 
**** Added 'if' statement to accommodate addWeightNorm (false if .json -- see comments)

*** Now, in A1/cells/tuning/37C_fits/ITS4 --> there are two .json files, one called *ITS4_reduced_cellParams_withSecLists.json*, which is the new .json file, saved from the .py file -- *has -75 as vinit in globals*, *has the appropriate secLists*, *has a different, smaller SOMA DIAMETER which is the ORIGINAL SOMA DIAMETER* 
** New ITS4_reduced_cellParams_withSecLists.json file has *2 major differences* from cells/ITS4_reduced_cellParams.json
*** Reassurance: has v_init set to -75
*** Has the appropriate secLists
*** has a different, SMALLER soma diameter, which is reflective of the original soma diameter
** *DONE* Check if this makes a difference in the network --> 
*** First, on local machine, in ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1 --> run 'python -i netParams.py'
*** ^^ I want to see what the deal is in terms of connParams using secLists keys for 'sec' <-- trying to figure out from netpyne code itself if this is valid. want to assume so, but! never know. 
** *TO DO* Test ITS4 behavior when driven by AMPA/NMDA synapse (vs. IClamp) 
** *TO DO* Check out NGF cell firing delay / length of activity after single spike input from ITS4 (see screenshot of salva's chat from March 2)
** *TO DO* --> Go thru rest of cell types and make sure that excitatory thalamic input is going to postsynaptic dends, for all cells that have dends. 
*** Question on excitatory inputs from thalamic cells:
**** okay, so, this dend vs. soma issue was taken care of for thalamocortical 
**** What about intrathalamic excitation? 
**** Do we have any similar concerns about corticothalamic input? because this is all going into soma as well. 
**** For intracortical excitatory input, this is all going along the dends. 
** *TO DO* Set tab in sublime setting preferences to 4 spaces, not 1 tab, or whatever the correct wording is
** *ISSUE*: What is the deal with the secLists...??? Does this actually work? I guess just bring it up to Sam and then try it in the network. ???

** VIP cell changes to make after E-> dend modifications:
*** Change VIP cell soma size -- do this after doing dend modifications
*** Delete 23C globals key 
** Organizing A1/cells dir on erica branch (and localmachine):
*** moving ITP4_A1_cellParams.json and IT5B_A1_cellParams.json into cells/tuning/misc_files --> checked IT5B_A1_cellParams.json and the params are outdated compared to the ones in 37C_fits. 
*** rm sTI_netpyne.py (was old and unfinished)
*** moved all files with *37C.json to 37C_files_redundant directory, which was then moved to cells/tuning/misc_files/37C_files_redundant --> these have the correct params but not the correct soma pt3d locations (later corrected by salva and reflected in the current A1/cells/ *.json files) 
*** In *tuning* subdir:
**** NGF and VIP subdirs reflect files from recent testing 
**** ITS4 
***** 'ITS4' currently in A1/cells is an old directory, and ITS4_newer reflects the recent testing, but ITS4 is currently in github, so need to rearrange this 
***** moved ITS4 dir into A1/cells/tuning/misc_files/ITS4_misc/ITS4 (this is the old directory!)
***** A1/cells/tuning/ITS4 reflects recent changes that generated the new _withSecLists.json file! 
**** in misc_files/testing_scripts, various rendering or testing scripts that could be useful 
** Potential netParams changes to come:
*** Intrathalamic E->E/I
**** E->E doesn't matter because all E pops in thalamus only have 1 compartment
**** E->I --> is this actually accounted for or not? effectively yes...? Either way, only TI (thal interneuron) has 'dend' compartment as well as 'soma'. 
*** Corticothalamic E->E/I
**** E->E doesn't matter bc again, all E pops in thalamus only have 'soma' compartment (no dend to input to). 
**** E->I same issue as above in intrathalamic; if change this, only change it for TI.

** Look at ITP4:
*** Showed auditory channel traces with ITP4 --> what's the deal with it leveling off and not firing? Try out this cell on its own. Hm. 
*** A1/cells/tuning
*** mkdir ITP4

** [TO DO] Try some runs with higher IEGain
** run5_ITP4:

** run7_ITP4:
*** cfg.IEGain = 1.25, cfg.IIGain = 1.0, gain for thal --> ITP4 in thalamocortical is 5 * cfg.thalamoCorticalGain
*** depol block at the end there -- took a while to set in, but got there eventually :( 
** run8_ITP4:
*** cfg.EIGain --> lowered to 1.2!!! (from 1.8600534795309025), cfg.IEGain = 1.25, cfg.IIGain = 1.0, gain for thal --> ITP4 in thalamocortical is 5 * cfg.thalamoCorticalGain
* <2020-08-11 Tue -- network tuning>
** Why would every cell but NGF be going into depol block? Probably because they're all being driven by something together, but by way too much, and NGF is the only one that isn't in depol block. 
** Are we driving too hard with thalamus -> cortex? thal cells keep firing tonically. Try lowering thalamoCorticalGain.

*** netParams v33 
*** ^^ ugh didn't make a diff bc TCM didn't fire :( 
* <2020-08-12 Wed -- network tuning>
** Focus today is on thalamus 
** Look at the circuitry being presented here... hmm... how does TI fit into this? does TI also take part in the matrix pathway? How come I can get TCM to stop firing but TC keeps firing? 
** Which sims does TCM become quiescent? 
** OBSERVATION: what could be driving the tonic firing in the TC cells...? Well --> the only E pops that reliably don't go into depol block are IT5A, CT5B, and sometimes CT5A. Keep seeing if this holds true. 
*** True for runs 1-4, 8_ITP4
*** 5_ITP4, 6_ITP4 not much activity
*** 7_ITP4 -- not enough activity until the end to really see 
*** 9_ITP4 -- not enough activity (what about oscillatory matrix type activity down at the bottom - what's that about??) 
*** 10_ITP4 -- take a closer look at this again to get a clue about the interneuron activity 
* <2020-08-14 Fri - network tuning>
** Add in separate population of TI cells for matrix:
*** v34 in netParams.py
*** Changes to make in netParams.py:
**** [DONE] netParams.popParams['TIM'] to Thalamic Populations section
**** [DONE] Add 'TIM' to TIpops in #Intrathalamic section of Thalamic connectivity parameters
**** [DONE] Adjust density in netParams.popParams['TIM']????? --> YES. Made them both 0.33 * thalDensity (Salva approves). 
**** Adjust connectivity files, params, etc: 
**** QUESTIONS:
***** [DONE] cochlea/IC -> thal netParams.connParams['IC->ThalI'] --> cellTypes RE and TI should be sufficient, yes? [YES]
***** [DONE] Create TIM_reduced_cellParams.json from TI? or no? [FAIRLY SURE NO bc of RE --> BUT MAKE SURE]
***** [DONE] cellParamLabels  --> add 'TIM_reduced' to the list? or no? maybe not?  [FAIRLY SURE NO bc of RE --> BUT MAKE SURE]
***** ^^ CONFIRM THESE THINGS ARE OKAY, NO ISSUES, in SEPARATE TIM DIRECTORY IN cells/tuning/TIM --> yeah most likely; didn't see anything too odd (geom? anything? weightNorm?) 
***** WeightNorm need to be changed at all???
**** TIM testing:

** Edited cfg.py to reduce EEGain to 1.0 (from optuna param of 1.9405846115921952) --> added, committed, pushed (not pulled yet on neurosim)
* <2020-09-01 Tue -- software housekeeping>
** Updated to catalina
** Updated neuron to 7.8 
** Updated .tcshrc file to reflect this 
** Testing netpyne / neuron -- see admin_nb.org for more details!!! 
** Update netpyne development branch:
*** see 07-06-2020 entry
*** *STEPS BELOW (COPY-PASTED FROM THAT ENTRY):*
*** cd ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/netpyne
*** git branch 
*** git checkout development 
*** git pull upstream development
**** This pulls changes from upstream/development (so development branch of neurosim netpyne github)
**** some people would do git pull --rebase upstream development, which does git fetch, then git rebase
**** git pull does git fetch, then git merge. This is evidently safer but not as clean. 
*** git push origin development
**** This pushes the changes that were just pulled into my cloned forked repo
*** *DID NOT DO THESE STEPS:*
*** git checkout csd
**** switch to feature branch
*** git merge development
**** merge in changes from the dev branch 
*** fixed merge conflict
**** conflict is in netpyne/analysis/__init__.py

I did git add .
Then did git reset because I realized I added everything + did some other shit – look back at terminal and record


did git merge salva  another cfg.py merge conflict

**** *[DONE]* (a) ITS4_reduced & VIP_reduced <-- special .json files for loading in salva branch, or did he change these? check status in erica and salva branch, then deal with this issue in netParams.py
***** *First* check to see if the special .json files exist in salva's branch
***** ^^ They don't!! Copied over ITS4_reduced_cellParams.json and VIP_reduced_cellParams.json to see if they contain the changes I made to these files with respect to the 'special' changes. 
***** *Second*, check if the special loading lines exist in salva's netParams.py (think they don't)  --> *CORRECT, THEY DO NOT*
***** It appears that the ITS4_reduced_cellParams.json and VIP_reduced_cellParams.json files are not the ones that salva is using in his branch. CHANGE THESE FILES. 
***** *CHANGED NETPARAMS.PY AND CHANGED THE CELL FILES* (see VIP_reduced and ITS4_reduced entry later for more details on the .json files)
**** *[DONE]* ^^ Change ITS4_reduced and VIP_reduced .json files for cell loading 
**** *[DONE]* (b) CHANGED 'sec' to 'proximal' from sec in ## E-> I because I defined 'sec' in a part of the code I am now taking out. (if NGF in post and if VIP in post, to specify synWeightFactor and also was having NGF get input at dend_all, VIP at ori1, and the rest at 'proximal' --> didn't matter, so changing all to proximal). 
**** *[DONE]* (c) thalamoCorticalGainNGF1 in netParams.py (TCM --> NGF1) stuff in salva vs. my branch. Got rid of this factor in cfg.py 
*** (2) *cfg.py*: 
**** *[DONE]* (a) Also noted above in conflict resolutions, but getting rid of the following cellGids and popGidRecord stuff in cfg.py -- check to see if also gone in cfg.py in salva branch --> *THEY ARE NOT IN SALVA VERSION OF CFG.PY*:

*** AUTHORS: Nima Mesgarani, Stephen V. David, Jonathan B. Fritz, and Shihab A. Shamma
*** Mentions the "Method of stimulus reconstruction" -- 
**** This method "uses a linear spectro-temporal model to map neural population responses to an estimate of the stimulus spectrogram"
**** ^^ However, from the first two papers mentioned above, recall that seems like this *linear model is only sufficient for the slower temporal modulations (e.g. at the syllabic rate)*
**** ... while a *non-linear model* was needed for the *faster modulations.*
**** ^^ However, this was indeed in nonprimary cortex; have a hunch that would be the same potentially in primary as well. 
*** The benefit of *using prior knowledge in stim reconstruction*:
**** They make the point that prior knowledge of the the "statistical regularities" in the natural sound stimuli improve the accuracy of the reconstruction 
**** Makes intuitive sense in the real world -- e.g. easier to understand someone if you kinda have an idea of what they might be saying next; in an extreme sense, perhaps similar to how we can't parse words from languages we don't understand).
**** Wonder if this would impact / help the oscillations paper at all?
*** Some approaches for understanding what is being encoded by neuron populations: 
**** "...examine the distribution of some tuning property measured for a large set of neurons (De Valois et al. 1982; Ferragamo et al. 1998)"
**** STRFs -- "...study ensemble tuning across a large number of spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) or other tuning curves (Woolley et al. 2005)"
**** PSTH (peristimulus time histogram responses) -- "A more complete understanding of population codes can be developed by visualizing peristimulus time histogram (PSTH) responses to several different stimuli after sorting the neurons according to their selectivity."
*** *Limitation of PSTH* (described in above point) -- 
**** Requires pre-selection of a tuned feature (e.g. best frequency, bandwidth, etc.)
**** So --> what if you don't know what parameters are being encoded? can only find, but not discover, so to speak. 
*** *Limitation of average tuning curve approach* -- 
**** Difference in "relative size of average tuning curves" can be due to difference in gain, more "representation of a specific range of stimulus features", OR lack of encoding. 
**** So, there is noise -- you can see that one tuning curve may be different 'size' than another, but no idea if it's due to gain, range of representation of a particular stimulus, because one feature isn't being strongly encoded. 
*** *The Method of Reverse Reconstruction*:
**** (Bialek et al. 1991; Gielen et al. 1988; Hesselmans and Johannesma 1989) 
**** "...finds the *best approximation of the input stimulus*, which can be compared with the original to discover *which features are preserved or absent* in the population response."
*** LGN reverse reconstruction: 
**** (Stanley et al. 1999)
**** ^^ Could this be used possible for MGB then??
*** "... potential bias from correlation in the neural responses is no longer an issue" --> sort of have a feel for what this might mean, but not toally. 
*** *Optimal prior reconstruction* vs. *Flat prior reconstruction*
**** optimal -- 
***** incorporates prior "knowledge of stimulus context"
***** "...shows the entire set of stimulus features that can be inferred from the population responses." <-- i.e. even if a feature isn't explicitly encoded, if a correlated feature is, it can still be inferred. 
**** flat -- uses "only information about neuronal receptive field properties" (*what does this mean exactly?*)
***** "...reflects only the actual coding scheme of the neurons"
***** -- okay but how?!
**** ^^ These two approaches can be complementary; can provide an upper and lower bound, so to speak. 
**** Can show the extent to which prior knowledge helps improve inference of stimulus information 
**** ^^ *Is there anything here to be said about bayesian statistics...?*
*** Reconstruction method(s) here were used on *complex ripple noise* (Klein et al. 2000), and *natural speech stimuli* (Garofolo 1993). 
*** This ^^ was done from A1 neurons in *awake ferret*
*** Experiment structure:
**** Optimal and Flat should produce the same representation from ripple noise. (because it contains ... "no correlations" ?)  --> *256 neurons*
**** Natural speech data should show the delta in reconstruction accuracy btwn optimal and flat. --> *250 neurons*
**** Then examine how reconstruction is affected by behavioral-induced plasticity (*HOW*) --> *4-22 neurons*
*** *QUESTION* -- 
**** From the "neurophysiological recording" section -- what does "single unit isolation of stable waveforms mean?"  
*** * OH I SEE WHAT THEY MEAN! * --> by flat and optimal prior, they mean "flat priors" -- like all the same prior probabilities. 
*** *QUESTION* -- what does "stimulus correlations" mean exactly? 
*** OPTIMAL PRIOR RECONSTRUCTION:
**** Looks like this does a kind of channel-by-channel approach? Hm. 
*** FLAT PRIOR RECONSTRUCTION:
**** --> estimated the STRF for each neuron (spectro-temporal receptive field). 
*** *QUESTION*-- 
**** "In the limit of infinite sampling, any remaining reconstruction error reflects stimuli that are either not encoded by the neural population or stimuli that are encoded nonlinearly in such a way that the linear reconstruction filter cannot capture them. Because of the diversity of nonlinear responses across neurons, this latter category is likely to be small; thus in practice, reconstruction error can be interpreted as reflecting stimuli that simply are not encoded."
**** ^^ Don't understand how we get from the end of sentence one to the beginning of sentence 2. ???
*** *IDEA* -- 
**** page 14/29, when they're talking about behavior-induced plasticity. They mention simulated data, and mention "enhancing the tuning of the STRFs to the target frequency for the neurons with best frequency close to the target tone (active STRFs) (Fritz et al. 2003)." <-- Something to do here?? 
*** *ACCURACY* for optimal prior reconstruction was best for low modulation frequencies (again -- makes sense) -- *IDEA* <-- something to do here in terms of delta/theta oscillations...? 
*** *QUESTION ABOUT MACAQUES* -- 
**** "The regions of smallest error represent spectro-temporal features that are encoded with the greatest fidelity in AI. These regions are consistent with patterns of perceptual modulation sensitivity measured in ferrets."
**** ^^ What are these analogous to in macaques?? 
**** Also -- "They also correspond to the region of the modulation spectrum that contains the most energy in natural sounds (Singh and Theunissen 2003)."
**** ^^ Would this hold true in macaques as well? 
*** More slow vs fast:
**** "For slow temporal modulations (4–12 Hz), the error converges to substantially lower values than for the fast rates (40–48 Hz)."
**** "A likely reason for the higher bounds at high rates and scales is the loss of encoded information as cortical neurons fail to phase-lock to these faster and denser modulations." <-- *but what about the linear vs non-linear aspect of things...? (see above papers perhaps)*
*** *Convex projection method* --> from spectrogram to acoustic signal. (Chi et al 2005) 
*** *Understand the behavior-driven plasticity stuff a little more* -- could be something here. 
**** e.g. "We found that, during a tone detection task, changes in tuning at the frequency of the target tone can be shown by the trace they induce in the difference between original and reconstructed spectrograms. One can extrapolate from this simple example to more intricate situations where top-down influences such as attention, expectation, or memory might modify receptive field shapes. For instance, changes induced in detecting an amplitude-modulated target tone or a specific phoneme might span many frequencies and time lags. These changes could be expressed differently in each STRF, depending on its BF (best frequency) and other baseline spectro-temporal properties, but they may have a systematic effect on the reconstructed stimulus. This approach may be particularly valuable for behaviors requiring the discrimination of temporal features, where no systematic changes have yet been identified in STRFs or tuning curves, despite the importance of temporal processing for many auditory behaviors (Shannon et al. 1995)."

*** DECODING:
**** TFM == "time-frequency match" component 
**** TSM == "temporal sequence match" 
* <2020-09-04 Fri -- papers>
** okay so think so far
*** What ideas have I gotten?
*** So, maybe time to refresh myself on the hypotheses and experimental structures of the in vivo experiments (refer to WIP #2). 
*** There is the circuitry-based hypothesis (potentially), that entrainment occurs due to supgragranular interneurons getting input from the nonspecific matrix pathway. 
*** There is also the hypothesis (aim) that delta-theta band oscillations will synchronize to naturalistic, quasi-rhythmic stimuli. 
*** So --> again, but what does this mean, because I don't think (if I recall correctly), that we mean a scenario where the oscillations phase-lock to the actual envelope of the total signal. 
*** Right (from reviewing my Journal Club 04/06/2020 presentation) --> what's happening is --> let's start with thinking about a specific piece of the cochlea --> that portion is attending to a certain band of frequencies ("critical band") --> in other words, the total sound signal is band-filtered by this portion of the cochlea --> then oscillations occurring in auditory cortex phase-lock to the ENVELOPE of this critical band signal. 
*** BUT, what do I make of that? aren't oscillations occurring kind of ... too broadly for us to see that they are tracking the envelopes of certain critical bands? are these critical band oscillations synchronized? such that... it actually does seem like the total sound signal (or some portion of it) is what is being phase-locked to? 
** Resolve the above question -- 
*** From the paper I did my journal club on back in april, it appeared that oscillations in A1 phase-lock to the critical band envelope of the filtered sound signal. However, how does this work? In other words... do the waveforms of different critical bands have uncorrelated or highly correlated envelopes? I would think highly correlated, because otherwise how could oscillations in cortex phase-lock...? If they were wildly different, than how would this even look?  --> 
*** SO, re-read the key parts of that paper and note this "...cortical delta-theta oscillations track the cortical-band envelopes of the stimulus." EnvelopeS. Plural! and I also recalled in the experimental structure that they band-filtered the sound signal, manipulated the envelopes, and then made a re-composite of them again to judge their intelligibility. 
*** So then yes, it would appear that the envelopes of the critical band are what are being tracked. I wonder how much the envelope of the entire sound signal differs from the envelopes of the critical band? 
*** In other words, to what extent was it necessary for them to decompose the signal into those bands and then manipulate the envelopes? Could this same effect have been achieved if those manipulations were applied to the entire envelope? 
*** What were the manipulations --> no-theta (no syllable-rate fluctuations, filters out all the low-frequency stuff), channel-theta (take the control stimuli basically, but replace the 'peaks' with peaks of uniform height and shape -- turns them into JUST cues about timing; removes the acoustic info), then no-theta + ch-theta, then ah, no-theta + global theta (in this, peak-picking was done on the entire so-called broadband envelope). 
*** I gotta say, no-theta + ch-theta was more intelligible to me than no-theta + global-theta (do the results agree?) -- yes. 
*** QUESTION -- was the cerebro-acoustic coherence using Pa (power from specific frequency from the acoustic envelope) being done on the broadband envelope or a critical-band filtered envelope?
*** Here's where I confused myself. There's like, a few different layers here. Okay I think I've got it --
*** So there sound signal comes in (the broadband signal), and this is a composite waveform comprised of many different frequency waveforms of periodically differing amplitude. 
*** The cochlea systematically extracts/filters the waves that are within a certain upper and lower frequency bound. The *envelope* of this waveform-within-the-waveform is of a certain frequency as well. 
*** Need to resolve the question below now. 
** Resolve another related question --> From the critical bands in the cochlea --> do we see this restricted range preserved upstream until A1? or does the downstream processing of the signal (between cochlea and cortex), remix this in some way? 
** So go through the pathway and see if I can make sense of each of the transformations that occur --> 
** Cochlea:
*** Sound wave enters the ear
*** Cochlea band-filters the broadband signal 
*** These signals travel, I believe, into the auditory nerve (CN VIII)
*** "Wavelet transform"
*** *How is this transmitted? aka what is the method of signal transduction?* --> *HAIR CELLS* (mechanotransduction) 
*** So then let me think. I know that the hair cells work on mechanotransduction, and don't actually produce action potentials themselves. But they do depolarize in response to movement, allowing an inlux of calcium (and K+) ions that causes neurotransmitter release from the basal end of the cell. 
*** This neurotransmitter release then binds postsynaptically to the (auditory portion of the) cochlear nerve endings, triggering action potentials there. 
*** *WHICH NEUROTRANSMITTER* --> glutamate? seems like it. 
*** So then what would this look like. Let me think about a small portion of the cochlea, one devoted to a particular critical band (due to structure! so cool). Okay, so --> 
*** Let me focus on one frequency, so to speak. Let's say that it comes in, and the hair cell moves to a degree that correlates with the amplitude (intensity) of the signal at that point. 
*** More movement --> more calcium --> more calcium, more glutamate release --> more glu release, more PROBABILITY of an action potential, no...? --> right, so then, higher frequency of firing. 
*** So then, amplitude of the signal is converted to frequency of firing. I see. 
*** --> So then it kind of really makes sense that the envelope is what is being tracked, because in fact what is being ENCODED is the envelope. wow. okay. 
** Cochlear nuclei:
*** Ventral and Dorsal
*** Tonotopic organization seems to be preserved 
*** Seems the *VENTRAL* cochlear nucleus extracts temporal and spectral info about the sound signal
*** Whereas the dorsal cochlear nucleus integrates acoustic and somatosensory info for spectral localization of sound. 
*** *VENTRAL* thus is the one that is relevant to us. 
*** Bushy, stellate, and octopus cells. 
*** ^^ Perhaps the features that are detected here could be relevant clues to what features are encoded cortically?
*** THE *STELLATE CELLS* of the dorsal cochlear nucleus --> tonotopic, encodes SPECTRA of sound signals --> 
**** dendrites of stellate cells span only small range of the tonotopic array of auditory nerve fibers
**** aka receive input from few (~10) auditory nerve fibers!!
**** They detect *intensity* over a NARROW FREQUENCY RANGE -- continuous representation of the spectrogram basically. 
**** SHARPLY TUNED --> this makes sense. 
**** small depolarizing currents (in contrast to octopus cells) cause large, protracted voltage changes, and slower EPSPs. 
*** *OCTOPUS CELLS* - "detect periodicity in sounds" and "onset transients" 
**** These are much more broadly tuned than stellate cells; these span a large proportion of the array of afferent auditory nerve fibers 
**** Rapid, precisely timed synaptic potentials; rapidly responsive
**** but require large synaptic currents to fire <-- so, many simultaneous inputs from auditory nerve fibers ("rising phase of numerous synaptic inputs") 
**** ^^ "...detect coincident firing in the relatively large number of cochlear nerve fibers that contact them."
**** ^^ "coincident firing... is produced by periodic sounds such as VOWELS and MUSICAL sounds (??) and by the *onset of broadband sounds found in consonants or clicks.*" 
*** SO... the octopus cells are *crucial for encoding timing* of key cues in the envelope, presumably, while the stellate cells are the ones that keep track of the acoustic, spectrogram-like info so to speak. 
*** Let's think about this again while including the rest of the downstream pathway. so the ear receives the broadband signal, cochlea band-filters this signal into narrow frequency ranges, this signal gets mechanotransduced by cochlear hair cells such that amplitude is converted to firing frequency, and the auditory signal frequency info is preserved by tonotopic organization of the cochlea --> cochlear nerve fibers. 
*** These signals travel up to the cochlear nuclei --> we are concerned specifically with the ventral cochlear nuclei --> The inputs remain tonotopically organized here --> 
*** Probably crudely stated, the octopus cells of this region span many of the frequency ranges, and look for coincident firing among the cochlear nerve fibers, which acts as a temporally PRECISE cue that a certain cue-sound has been heard. 
*** The stellate cells, meanwhile, are narrowly tuned to a tight frequency range of cochlear nerve fibers, and thus keep faithfully transmitting the spectrogram of the sound signal, in a similarly band-filtered fashion as the cochlear input. Probably some manipulation here that I am missing, but seems to be the general idea. Seems like may be some lateral inhibition here and perhaps some feedforward excitation from other stellate cells that helps sharpen the accuracy of the intensity encoding (though dulls the accuracy of the fine structure? hm). Resolution of intensity is in tens of ms.  
** Ignoring Superior Olivary Complex and Lateral Lemnisci --> 
*** These appear to mostly be involved in sound localization and creating a spatial map of sound input from the environment. 
*** probably more than this, but again - going crude and relatively quick here. 
** Hold up --> superior olive section of kandel's book specifically mentions phase-locking. 
** Inferior Colliculus:
*** IC receives input from lots of different cells and structures --> *including* *stellate cells of the contralateral ventral cochlear nucleus* --> recall that these are our spectrogram-encoding cells. So thisspectrogram-like input is going directly to contralateral IC. 
* <2020-09-06 Sun -- reading more about pathway>
** Dorsal Cochlear Nucleus
*** FUSIFORM CELLS
*** ^^ Receives input from stellate cells of ventral; along basal dendrites; little plasticity here
*** ^^ Receives input from other pathways at distal dendrites with more plasticity. (parallel fibers). 
*** Cochlear nerve inputs to dorsal cochlear nucleus are *tonotopically organized* in isofrequency laminae that run at right angles to parallel fibers. 
*** Integrates with *somatosensory* info and whatnot in order to make use of spectral cues for sound localization.
** Superior Olivary Complex
*** Looks like the superior olive only gets input from the *ventral acoustic stria* -- which come entirely from the ventral cochlear nucleus through the trapezoid body. 
*** SEPARATE pathways for interaural TIME differences and interaural INTENSITY differences. 
*** TIME: *MEDIAL SUPERIOR OLIVE* -- mentions use of *PHASE LOCKING* from ventral cochlear bushy cells! 
**** "Cochlear nerve fibers tuned to frequencies *below 4kHz* and their bushy cell targets [ /nb: in ventral cochlear nucleus/ ] encode counds by firing in phase with the pressure waves."
**** *QUESTION* --> what is the range of frequencies tuned for in the cochlea? --> 20Hz to 20kHz. 
**** Delay lines -- Fig 31-5 (pg 692) 
**** *SO BUSHY CELLS IN VENTRAL COCHLEAR NUCLEUS PHASE LOCK TO SOUND SIGNAL* 
**** The principal cells of the medial superior olive then have the delay-line set up (at least with respect to the contralateral cochlear nucleus). 
**** There is a dorsoventral vs. rostrocaudal distinction in here, with respect to the sheet of cells referenced in the medial superior olive --> *INTERAURAL PHASE* is represented in the *ROSTROCAUDAL* dimension, while the bushy cells' tonotopic innervation imposes a *TONOTOPIC* organization in the *DORSOVENTRAL* dimension. 
**** ^^ Thus, let me think through this. 
**** ^ Wrote about this in my teal notebook to draw it out. But basically, think of a spreadhseet of medial superior olive neurons, if you will. Then each 'row' in this sheet represents one (range of) frequency(ies) -- coming from one bushy cell input (from ventral cochlear nucleus). And each 'column' in this sheet is 1 interaural-timing/map-location in space. and so then when multiple cells in a particular "column" go off (aka a natural sound with multiple frequencies occurs in a particular location in space), then this helps disambiguate that a sound occurred in a particular location. 
*** INTENSITY: *LATERAL SUPERIOR OLIVE*
**** Not quite as interesting / relevant here -- but good to know. Uses bushy and stellate cells, etc. 
*** Olivary complex(es) provide feedback to cochlea -- interesting. 
** *NOTE* -- methinks that the phase-locking phenomenon is first identifiable with bushy cells in the ventral cochlear nucleus --> then continues on (if I understand the pathway correctly), with the *principal cells of the medial superior olive*
** Inferior Colliculus: 
*** All of the auditory pathways converge here -- 
**** Ventral Acoustic stria: ear --> cochlea --> CNVIII --> ventral cochlear nucleus --> trapezoid body --> superior olivary complex --> IC
**** Intermediate Acoustic stria: ear --> cochlea --> CNVIII --> Ventral cochlear nucleus --> Lateral Lemniscus --> IC 
**** Dorsal Acoustic stria: ear --> cochlea --> CNVIII --> ventral cochlear nucleus --> dorsal cochlear nucleus --> IC 
*** Many important excitatory inputs --> (page 694) --> including souces of info about amplitude ( /nb: envelope shape, no?/ ) via stellate cells from ventral cochlear nucleus, and *PHASE LOCKING* (my deduction, at least), from the principal cells of the *medial superior olive* 
*** Contains: *central nucleus*, *dorsal cortex*, and *external cortex*
*** *CENTRAL NUCLEUS* is *TONOTOPICALLY ORGANIZED*
*** pg 695 states that many of the neurons in central nucleus contain info about location of sound sources / are sensitive to interaural time differences --> to me this implies they are part of the pathway that starts with the bushy cells and goes to the medial superior olive. Thus, there are probably cells here that are preserving the *PHASE LOCKING*. 
* <2020-09-07 Mon -- reading more about pathway>
** ^^ to pick back up from yesterday... *Central Nucleus* of the *Inferior Colliculus* is tonotopically organized and is most likely part of the pathway that starts with the phase-locking bushy cells and then goes to the medial superior olive (Ventral Acoustic Stria). 
** Central Nucleus neurons *project to the thalamus* as well 
** *IC --> A1*
*** IC --> MGB --> A1
*** IC pathways (efferent) goes to core and belt auditory pathways
*** MGB <--> A1 project to and from each other 
** Auditory Cortex:
*** "Neurons are arrayed in a systematic map reflecting the frequencies that best stimulate them."
*** So... neurons tuned to low frequencies are found at *rostral* end of A1, while higher frequencies are found in *caudal* regions of A1. 
*** *QUESTION* -- repeated below; WHICH cell types in A1 are the ones that are frequency-tuned?? 
*** iso-frequency contours exist along one dimension of A1 while smooth frequency gradient occurs in the other direction
*** Auditory neurons in A1 (*AGAIN -- WHICH CELL TYPES DOES THIS MEAN, AND IN WHICH LAYERS??*) can be excited by inputs from both ears ("EE") or by only ipsilateral ear (EI -- inhibited by stim from other ear).
*** "Summation columns" (*what does this mean?*) of EE neurons alternate with "suppression columns (*again what does this mean?*) of EI neurons --> especially true in higher frequencies. 
*** ^^ Does the higher frequency thing matter at all for us... hm... only connection I can see from here is that it is the lower frequency bushy cells that do phase-locking...? hm. 
*** ^^ Seems the EE and EI columns would be useful for *sound localization* no? So if that is the case... would these be potentially using info from the localization pathways in the superior olivary complex (via the ventral acoustic stria? and I guess probably I could also see dorsal acoustic stria...)? 
*** ^^ The ORIENTATION of these columns is at "right angles to the axis of tonotopic mapping" --> somehow this intuitively makes sense. like in medial superior olive, you'd want to be able to disambiguate location by making use of the fact that natural sounds have many frequencies, so a whole "column" could light up (or many parts of the column) would light up at once. 
*** ^^ *MY QUESTION IS ---> HOW DOES THIS TRANSLATE TO A LAMINAR VIEW OF CORTEX???* 
** *QUESTION* -- *WHICH cell types* in A1 are the ones that are frequency-tuned?? -->
*** So we know that the bushy cells in cochlear nucleus (ventral) are narrowly (relatively speaking) tuned, and then the medial superior olive has tonotopic organization, and the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus is also tonotopically organized. 
*** So then, if that's all true, and the central nucleus projects to MGB of the thalamus... Does medial geniculate body somehow preserve this tonotopic organization / frequency tuning...?? I would have to imagine that it does somehow, because we know overall that A1 is tonotopically organized. [ *quick google search shows that yes there is plenty of tonotopic organization in MGB* ]
*** So then, if MGB somehow preserves this information, then ... well, would the cells in L4, the ones receiving input from MGB, would these be the ones that are frequency tuned? Or would it in essence be all of (or most of?) the excitatory cells in that particular column....???? Hm!  
** *QUESTION* -- related to the above, when it comes to the EE, EI columns that alternate in I guess the more caudal regions of A1... what does this look like in terms of a laminar view of the cortex? What cell circuitry are we talking about here?

** Reconstructing Speech from Human Auditory Cortex 
*** Authors: Brian N. Pasley, Stephen V. David, Nima Mesgarani, Adeen Flinker, Shihab A. Shamma, Nathan E. Crone, Robert T. Knight, Edward F. Chang (2012) 
*** This was done from intracranial recordings in human *nonprimary* auditory cortex -- read anyway.
*** *LINEAR* model based on auditory spectrogram: accurately reconstructed slow and intermediate temporal fluctuations (e.g. those corresponding to syllable rate)
*** *NONLINEAR* sound representation based on temporal modulation energy: reconstruction of fast temporal fluctuations (e.g. syllable onsets and offsets) 
*** ^^ What do I know about these things in the context of the downstream pathway? 
**** so, according to above, look at ventral cochlear nucleus
**** the stellate cells I said were the ones that encode the kind of intensity modulations within a narrow frequency range. taken together they are transmitting the spectrogram, so to speak. 
**** the octopus cells are broadly tuned, and they look for coincident firing amongst many cochlear nerve fibers, and are activated by "periodic sounds such as VOWELS and MUSICAL sounds (??) and by the *onset of broadband sounds found in consonants or clicks.*" 
**** meanwhile the bushy cells are transmitting info about fine temporal structure of the sound, so to speak -- they are in between octopus and stellate cells, aka more narrowly tuned than octopus, but require larger synaptic inputs than stellate. 
*** What I'm confused about then, or rather, what I am immediately wondering, is that there's this distinction in the upstream cortical end-product so to speak, btwn what is needed to reconstruct the slow and intermediate fluctuations (linear) vs what is needed to reconstruct the fast temporal flucturations (nonlinear). 
*** ^^ so, to continue then...  I guess kind of where does it start, or how do I think of those cochlear cells / resultant pathways in terms of what they're saying here. 
**** On the one hand, I have the bushy cells which they SAY correspond to the fine temporal structure but then on the other hand seem to also phase-lock to pressure waves, which to me seem like they would come in at syllable rate (seems like this was even stated in the text). 
**** So that, to me, vaguely seems like a contradiction.
**** So, maybe the octopus cells are -- wait a second. 
*** REVISIT KANDEL PAGE 686
**** Ventral Cochlear Nucleus
**** Bushy cells
***** (1) *LARGE* spherical bushy cells -- sense LOW FREQUENCIES (like ones that correspond to cochlear nerve fibers that are tuned to < 4kHz) and project bilaterally to medial superior olive to form a circuit to detect interaural time delay. 
***** ^^ <-- TIME DIFFERENCES
***** ^^ <-- cochlear nerve fibers - SYNAPSE - bushy cells in v coch nuc - SYNAPSE - medial superior olive [2 so far]
***** (2) *SMALL* spherical bushy cells and globular bushy cells -- sense HIGH frequencies are are associated with the lateral superior olive. 
***** small spherical bushy cells excite ipsilateral lateral superior olive. 
***** ^^ <-- INTENSITY DIFFERENCES
***** ^^ <-- cochlear nerve fibers - SYNAPSE - SMALL bushy cells in v coch nuc - SYNAPSE - lateral superior olive [2 so far] 
***** (3) *globular bushy cells* go thru trapezoid body (contralateral), and these projections in turn inhibit principal cells of the lateral superior olive. 
***** ^^ <-- INTENSITY DIFFERENCES  
***** ^^ <-- cochlear nerve fibers - SYNAPSE - globular bushy cells in v coch nuc - SYNAPSE - trapezoid body - SYNAPSE - lateral superior olive [3 so far]
**** Stellate Cells
*****  ^^ <-- cochlear nerve fibers - SYNAPSE - stellate cells in v coch nuc - SYNAPSE - ipsilateral lateral superior olive / contralateral ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus [2 so far]
*** ^^ So it kind of makes sense here that octopus cells are encoding the temporal precision of the syllable onsets / offsets. These are the most temporally precise. And perhaps there is some overlap between octopus and bushy cells in terms of the "temporal fine structure of sounds" -- which bushy cells definitely encode. Okay.

*** ^^ average modulation- based tuning curves preserve sensitivity to much higher rates approaching 32 Hz (Figure 5B and C).

*** Still confused by this language of "auditory representations" and how they generate "predictions" --> what exactly is the step-by-step process here? *LOOK INTO THE ALGORITHM* --> *COME UP WITH A MORE SENSIBLE SUMMARY FIGURE*
*** *PAGE 8* has some interesting stuff: 
**** The primary difference between the linear spectrogram and nonlinear modulation models was evident in the predictive accuracy for fast temporal modulations (Figure 5). To understand why the nonlinear modulation model performed better at fast modulation rates, it is useful to consider how the linear and nonlinear models make different assumptions about neural coding. The linear and nonlinear models are specified by different choices of stimulus representation. The linear model assumes a linear mapping between neural responses and the auditory spectrogram. The nonlinear model assumes a linear mapping between neural responses and the modulation representation. The modulation representation itself is a nonlinear transforma- tion of the spectrogram and is based on emergent tuning properties that have been identified in the auditory cortex [18].
**** "...This suggests that phase-locking to the amplitude envelope is less robust at higher temporal rates and may instead be coded by an energy-based scheme [37]."
*** Interesting idea about the reconstruction of STG info not being totally possible because of what is being represented in STG -- in other words, this may be a more abstracted set of information that is taking off into the brain in order to mingle with other cognates and whatnot (my words). Interesting. --> *how does this apply to A1*
** 'Taxonomy of neural oscillation events...' paper mentioned iEEG recordings from human STG --> could these be used at all??? These are the data type(s) mentioned in the above paper as well.

** ANY IDEAS BREWING: 
*** Find some code for these speech reconstruction algorithm(s)
*** Look at our speech stimuli --> availability of spectrogram of these stimuli? ability to turn stim into spectrogram (*code*)? 
*** The benefit of the model is that we can artificially change the "brain" side of the story fairly easily. 
*** So -- is there a role for this? 
*** *DECODING TO ENCODING* --> What kind of way(s) is(are) there to think about the linear spectrogram (envelope-based?) slow & intermediate decoding accuracy vs. the nonlinear, modulation-based decoding in terms of differences in ENCODING schemes? 
**** "Reconstructing the modulation representation proceeds simi- larly to the spectrogram, except that individual reconstructed stimulus components now correspond to modulation energy at different rates and scales instead of spectral energy at different acoustic frequencies (see Materials and Methods, Stimulus Reconstruction)" pg 4 
*** Is there a way to use the human iEEG STG data? What was presented to them? 
*** A SORT OF PLAN: 
**** first -- I have to look into how LFP vs ECoG data match up / don't match up in terms of what the data will look like and how it can be interpreted. 
**** I would have to be able to take LFP data and use this in the reconstruction algorithms mentioned by mesgarani, chang, etc. 
**** I would then have to feed the model auditory stimuli equivalent to that given to the macaques. 
**** I would have to gather the LFP / CSD data from the model. 
**** See if I can get reconstruction. 
**** Then, from there --> manipulate the model. Feed in auditory stimuli again. Gather the data. reconstruct. What is different in the reconstruction? 
**** ^^ What kind of questions could this answer? 
***** There is a distinction in the reconstruction literature between the linear and nonlinear model to capture slow & intermediate vs. fast envelope fluctuations. 
***** Freefrom brainstorming... could changing connectivity of some cell type to some cell type, or some layer to some layer... something like this... could something like this change differentially the slow & intermediate aspects vs. the fast aspects of the stimulus processing...??? 
***** This would fill in a missing piece then -- aka what network-level mechanisms exist that could underlie the need for linear vs nonlinear models to capture these different envelope fluctuations...? 
***** ^^ not just connectivity; any gains...? 
***** ^^ *What could possibly do this?*
***** ^^ *Secondly, and importantly, is this distinction indicative of something about the auditory processing itself? OR is this distinction indicative of something about the reconstruction algorithms?*
***** WAIT, but --> see Fig 5B of the reconstructing_speech.PDF paper (above). "Mean reconstruction accuracy (r) as a function of temporal modulation rate, averaged over all participants (N = 15). Modulation-based decoding accuracy (red curve) is higher compared to spectrogram-based decoding (blue curve) for temporal rates >4 Hz. In addition, spectrogram-based decoding accuracy is significantly greater than zero for lower modulation rates (<8 Hz), supporting the possibility of a dual modulation and envelope-based coding scheme for slow modulation rates. Shaded gray regions indicate SEM over participants."
***** ^^ This means that maybe it's as "trivial" as ... the syllable-rate stuff has dual schemes for encoding... one (or neither?) of which is linear... how to think about this. encoding vs. decoding. So perhaps, as we suspect, the lower frequencies (< 4-8 Hz) employ a phase-locking / envelope-based coding scheme that is no longer applied at the higher frequencies. 
***** Hm, well, perhaps what I was rambling about above still stands?

** "Towards reconstructing intelligible speech from the human auditory cortex"
*** Hassan Akbari, Bahar Khalighinejad, Jose L. Herrero, Ashesh D. Mehta & Nima Mesgarani (2018)
** Before I get into that paper above... I really should think about... taking this in a direction that feels temporally tractable to me. 
*** My instinct is that heading full steam into this direction could potentially be quite time-consuming. I'm seeing from the papers, like the one I ventured into yesterday, involves some degree of model fitting and use of various software packages. Seems doable, but seems like quite a task to be honest. 
*** I wonder if there's a way to kind of get into this without having to take it into the speech reconstruction arena. What ideas might I have. 
** Other ideas (related):
*** So, from what I've learned from Kandel chapter and what I've learned from the speech reconstruction papers that I have read is that there is a sort of distinction between the parts of the speech signal that can be reconstructed / represented (still kind of a link here in my head between these two) using (1) a linear model -- aka, *linear mapping* between the *neural responses and the auditory spectrogram*
*** Where as (2) there is also the nonlinear model aspect of things... which assumes a *linear mapping between neural responses and the modulation representation* -- where the 'modulation representation' is a nonlinear transformation of the spectrogram based on emergent tuning properties that have been identified in the auditory cortex. 
*** So from here I can think okay. here again I get a little tripped up between encoding and decoding. 
*** From the 'influence of context...' paper I see a quote, "The fidelity of their reconstruction shows the extent to which information about different spectro-temporal modulations is encoded in cortical responses." 
** Sensory cortex and tuning question(s):
*** So one question I do have here is that these neurons are not tuned to any particular frequency. How does this shake out in terms of our model? 
*** Or perhaps in some ways they ARE...? because of our cochlear model? The 'tuning' I would think happens mostly (entirely?), at least in this modality, to be the result of connectivity and computations arising from the level of the cochlea, essentially. If the cochlea wasn't specific, would these neurons develop the type and degree of specificity that they do? one would think not. 
*** ^^ Though a counterpoint would be the tuned neurons in visual cortex, e.g. the orientation selective cells/columns. It's not as if we have retinal cells that are tuned for certain orientations and that this gets preserved. at least I don't think so. 
** Curious what the network activity looks like with the ICoutput file going in. 
*** changed cfg.py
*** running on zn 
*** mpiexec -n 32 nrniv -python -mpi init.py
*** some kind of netParams.py error - try loading on its own and see what happens:
**** locally in ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1 --> python -i netParams.py --> Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "netParams.py", line 612, in <module>
    'weight': weightBkg[pop],
KeyError: 'IC'
**** Ah -- I had commented out pops.remove('IC') so I could record something -- uncommented now, try again locally. Loads. (though seems like still may be trying to use neuron 7.6...? figure this out later)
**** pushed the above changes, and then tried on 'zn' -- python -i netParams.py now loads, and python -i cfg.py now loads. try mpiexec again. 
** ^^ Have a feeling it will look the same; not sure why this would make any difference. 
** Things to mess with:

*** netParams.stimSourceParams['inhBkg'] and ['excBkg']
*** netParams.synMechParams['NMDA'] and ['AMPA'] --> should these be e=0..? is that the equilibrim potential these are trying to reach? hm.

*** no runaway excitation. well, virtually no excitatory cell activity in cortex, but lots and lots of NGF activity.

*** Change the conn to conn.pkl 
*** Change thalamoCorticalGain back to 1.0
*** reduce cfg.rateBkg['inh'] to 10 
*** Unexpectedly --> NGF rates went way up...? Perhaps this is due to using conn.pkl instead of connTest.pkl...? Not sure. 
*** Strangely *rhythmic activity in thal* started even before the speech stimulus, which is unexpected, but did increase upon arrival of the speech stimulus. NGF1 was active in the beginning slightly. Strange. 
*** some activity in IT5A 
*** I see --> This is actually just the amount of inhibition being fed to each pop, so it makes sense that this would actually increase the amount of baseline activity.

** TO DO -- look at this without the speech stimulus input:
*** I was starting to see some rhythmic activity in thal cells in manualTune3 prior to the onset of the speech stimulus.

*** Raster is not impressive --> look at traces 
*** thalL4 --> TC tonic firing creates tonic firing in ITP4 and depol block in ITS4 
*** L2 has sparse spiking (e.g. 1) in IT2, but then swamped by inhibitory activity 
*** Similarly for IT3 --> surprisingly, the NGF cells are not the ones that are swamping now. 
*** In 5A, for example, it seems like once the first excitatory cell gets going, then there is a FLURRY of inhibitory activity in the non-NGF inhib cells that ends up swamping all the excitatory activity, surprisingly.

** For afternoon --> again go back to reading; this is potentially a fool's errand. 
** So what was I starting to think about yesterday before I got sucked into the network stuff again:
*** I was thinking that adapting / tuning some kind of speech reconstruction algorithm might be too fraught with roadblocks. Potentially not, but I have a feeling that may be the case. 
*** So what is there instead, that nevertheless goes in this sort of direction?
*** Again there is the idea that for 'temporal modulation rates' of < 4-8 Hz (this is looking at the reconstructing_speech paper), that both envelope/spectrogram-based decoding ("linear") and modulation-based decoding hold, while for higher "temporal modulation rates" (>4Hz), that the modulation-based decoding ("nonlinear") is what works. 
*** So there is potentially a difference in what is being encoded, though I really feel like I need a better understanding of what these things mean concretely. I also need to go over those papers (citations 37-39) that deal with cellular basis of this distinction (potentially) ("energy-based scheme") <-- This may give me something. 
*** With the model, I may be able to manipulate the cellular mechanisms discussed in those papers, and then look to see what gets disrupted in terms of this type of encoding situation. hm. something like this. 
** "Slow and intermediate temporal fluctuations, such as those corresponding to syllable rate, were accurately reconstructed using a linear model based on the auditory spectrogram." 
** "...reconstruction of FAST temporal fluctuations, such as syllable onsets and offsets, required a nonlinear sound representation based on temporal modulation energy." 
*** Given the failure of the linear spectrogram model to reconstruct fast modulation rates, we evaluated competing models of auditory neural encoding. We investigated an alternative, nonlinear model based on modulation (described in detail in [18]). Speech sounds are characterized by both slow and fast temporal modulations (e.g., syllable rate versus onsets) as well as narrow and broad spectral modulations (e.g., harmonics versus formants) [7]. The modulation model represents these multi-resolution features explicitly through a complex wavelet analysis of the auditory spectrogram. Computationally, the modulation representation is generated by a population of modulation-selective filters that analyze the two-dimensional spectrogram and extract modulation energy (a nonlinear operation) at different temporal rates and spectral scales (Figure 6A) [18]. Conceptually, this transformation is similar to the modulus of a 2-D Fourier transform of the spectrogram, localized at each acoustic frequency [18]. The modulation model and applications to speech processing are described in detail in [18] and [7].
*** The nonlinear component of the model is phase invariance to the spectrogram envelope (Figure 6B). A fundamental difference with the linear spectrogram model is that phase invariance permits a nonlinear temporal coding scheme, whereby envelope fluctua- tions are encoded by amplitude rather than envelope-locking (Figure 6B). Such amplitude-based coding schemes are broadly referred to as ‘‘energy models’’ [32,33]. The modulation model therefore represents an auditory analog to the classical energy model of complex cells in the visual system [32–36], which are invariant to the spatial phase of visual stimuli.

*** ^^ question: what does it means to "run model several times with diff freq selectivity" --> does this mean our model...? the reconstruction model? 
** wang et al 2008
*** MGB can synchronize to much faster clicks than A1 
*** "greater degree of temporal-to-rate transformation in A1'
*** creation of separate synchronized and non-synchronized responses at MGB and A1. 
*** *POTENTIAL THING TO STUDY?* --> page 301, top left --> cortico-thalamic feedback circuits 
*** "Methods that rely on precise stimulus-locked discharges such as commonly used spike-triggered averaging techniques are inadequate to characterize neurons with unsynchronized responses. Alterative methods that take into consideration of such cortical firing patterns need be utilized (Barbour and Wang, 2003a,b) and further developed."
** Bendor and Wang 2007 (acoustic flutter):
*** "It has been shown that slowly repeating acoustic events are represented explicitly by stimulussynchronized neuronal firing patterns in primary auditory cortex (AI)."
*** so again similar to the paper above, we are going to examine synchronized vs non-synchronized responses, seems like. 
*** Repetition rates:
**** 10-45 Hz --> e.g. tapping of woodpecker, discretely sounding percept known as "acoustif flutter"
**** > 45 Hx --> above this can generate a pitch, which is a more continuous sounding percept
**** < 10 Hz --> individual acoustic events that occur distinctly in time 
**** ^^ "Slow repetition rates (or modulation frequencies) --> *QUESTION*: is this an "aka modulation frequencies" or "this also applies to slow modulation frequencies?" --> basically *what does modulation frequency mean?* 
**** " Furthermore, for both the auditory and somatosensory systems, this neural encoding boundary [n.b.: ~ 40Hz] also matches the perceptual discrete/continuous boundary for a sequence of sensory events4,5,13,14. Given these similarities, we hypothesized that other aspects of the way in which the percept of flutter is encoded in somatosensory cortex might also be found in auditory cortex."
**** *rate codes* --> "...in which the discharge rate is a monotonic function of a stimulus parameter"
**** "A1 contains a *dual temporal/rate representation* whereas cortical fields rostral to A1 predominantly use a monotonic rate code that is unsynchronized to acoustic flutter." 
**** *QUESTION* --> who is to say that the neurons that are not negative/positive monotonic neurons don't have discharge rates that are a monotonic function of some other parameter, other than repetition rate?
**** *QUESTION* --> where in the cortex were these neurons, with respect to laminar depth? any info on cortical depth or type of neuron? what else do we know about these cells? 
**** Responses: negative/positive monotonic (synchronized), mixed, non-monotonic 
**** Non-monotonic ^^ types --> (1) all-pass (discharge rate varied minimally with repetition rate over perceptual range of flutter; (2) bandpass; (3) low-pass, (4) high-pass, (5) multi-peak (complex) responses [pg 766]  
**** *HOW* were there monotonic responses in both synchronized and unsynchronized neurons...???? I thought that the whole point of monotonically responding neurons is that they were synchronized...? WAIT NO. ah, I'm mixing these up a little. 
**** Unsynchronized neurons had discharge rates that varied monotonically with repetition rate over the perceptual range of flutter.

*** "Laminar biophysical models of the thalamocortical system that accurately simulate recorded signals, such as local field potentials, can be used to predict the types of waveforms that are recorded in vivo after sensory stimulation, and offer mechanistic explanations for their features. For example, providing brief, strong thalamocortical activation to a hypothetical neocortical model would trigger production of a transient ERP-like event in the circuit, with a characteristic waveform (Neymotin et al., 2020b). Although running a wavelet filter on such a waveform will produce high power at a frequency inverse to the duration of the ERP, since it was produced by a punctate event, this type of waveform should not be considered an oscillation (Neymotin et al., 2020a). In contrast, specific synaptic connectivity and input patterns provided to a circuit model lead to production of sustained multi-cycle oscillations. Some of these circuit mechanisms and their implications in detecting oscillatory bursts from electrophysiology data in vivo are described in the next section."
*** "One of the major points raised here is that sustained oscillations can appear “bursty” in the presence of noise and conversely, “bursty” oscillations can appear sustained when averaged across trials."
*** Five features of short-lived oscillations that may provide information-coding space for the brain:
**** (1) Amplitude—indicates the size and synchronicity of the underlying neuronal population. 
**** (2) Temporal span (duration)—how long the synchrony within a population is maintained.
**** (3) Frequency span—might index the participant neuron circuits and critically, the inherent conductances of their specific neuronal constituents. When studied at the single-trial level, these features may explain variability in behavioral performance across trials that cannot be observed in the averaged waveforms.
**** (4) Inter-burst and stimulus-burst interaction–measures, such as the burst-rate, burst-timing, inter-burst interval, coefficient of variation, fano-factor and more complex spatio-temporal sequences comprised by transient bursts might be used to explore the single trial dynamics of oscillatory activity and non-oscillatory transient events. The general idea is to treat the timing of these transient events as a parallel point-process to study their temporal relationship with other events and with the stimulus. For example, determine the rhythmicity across events from a given oscillation frequency band (e.g., whether oscillatory events are rhythmic and predictable, or Poisson distributed). 
**** (5) Time-domain waveforms—might index different biophysical generators. We note that this feature is more abstract and challenging to measure but should be further studied to extract the meaningful features within the waveforms and test for repeating waveforms in the data. Time-domain waveforms may also reveal differences between oscillatory and non-oscillatory events that might differ in both their mechanisms and their role in information processing.

** NOTE ON SPECTROTEMPORAL MODULATIONS:
*** From: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3973426/
*** Speech is often characterized by its formant peaks, spectral edges, and amplitude modulations at onsets/offsets. These important features contribute to the energy modulations seen in speech spectrograms, both *over time within any given frequency channel*, and along the spectral axis over a given time window. 
*** Temporal modulation is defined in terms of modulation rate (in Hz), with higher rates indicating faster energy fluctuations. 
*** Spectral modulations are defined in terms of modulation density (cycles per octave [c/o]), with higher densities indicating more densely spaced spectral peaks. 
*** It has been suggested that speech intelligibility is highly dependent on low spectral modulation densities (<8 c/o) that reflect the formant structure of speech (Elhilali et al, 2003; Liu and Eddins, 2008) and low temporal modulation rates (<16 Hz) that reflect the phonetic and syllabic rate of speech (Steeneken and Houtgast, 1980; Drullman et al, 1994; Elhilali et al, 2003). While spectral and temporal modulation sensitivities are often tested separately, they often co-occur in natural sounds. Joint spectrotemporal modulation (STM) can be thought of in terms of spectral patterns that change over time or temporal modulation patterns that vary across frequency channels.

*** Speech reconstruction is an "inverse mapping technique that finds the best approximation of the acoustic stimulus from the populatin of evoked neural activity." 
*** Two types of regression models: linear regression, nonlinear DNN 
*** Two types of speech representations: auditory spectrogram, vocoder
*** (1) Linear --> Auditory Spectrogram
*** (2) Linear --> Vocoder Parameters
*** (3) DNN --> Feature Extraction (FCN) + Feature Summation (2-layer FCN) --> Auditory Spectrogram
*** (4) DNN --> Feature Extraction (FCN+LCN) + Feature Summation (2-layer FCN) --> Vocoder
*** DNN architecture:
**** DNN architecture, 2 modules: Feature Extraction and Feature Summation networks
**** Feature extraction for auditory spectrogram --> FCN (fully connected neural network)
**** Feature extraction network for vocoder reconstruction --> FCN concatenated with LCN (locally connected network). 
**** Feature summation network (for both vocoder and spectrogram?) --> two-layer FCN 
*** Investigate impact of *THREE FACTORS* on reconstruction accuracy:
**** (1) regression technique (linear regression or nonlinear DNN)
**** (2) Speech representation intended for reconstruction (auditory spectrogram or speech vocoder parameters)
**** (3) Neural frequency range used for regression (low-frequency envelope vs. high-gamma envelope) 
*** RESULTS --> *nonlinear DNN* using *all neural frequencies( to directly estimate parameters of a *speech vocoder* --> highest intelligibility
*** DIGIT SOUNDS --> 
**** 35. Liberman, M. et al. TI 46-Word LDC93S9. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia (1993).
*** ACOUSTIC REPRESENTATIONS:
**** Auditory spectrogram: 
***** Spectrogram is calculated using a model of the peripheral auditory system (from what exactly?), which estimates a time-frequency representation of the acoustic signal on a tonotopic frequency axis. 
***** Spectrogram --> Waveform, done using an "iterative convex optimization procedure" 
*** Little confused about the vocoder situation:
**** There are four main parameters that the WORLD algorithm uses to reconstruct the speech waveform: (1) spectral envelope (2) f0 or fundamental frequency, (3) aperiodicity, and (4) voice-unvoiced excitation label (VUV)
**** Then it says there are 516 total parameters in the vocoder.  
**** Is it that there are ... 129 * 4 of these things to calculate somehow...?? not sure. hm. :/ --> well, for auditory spectrogram reconstruction, i am seeing that there wre 128 frequency bands... maybe??
**** "...the 516-dimensional vocoder parameters (consisting of *513 spectral envelopes, pitch, voiced-unvoiced, and band periodicity*)"
*** Now little confused about the auditory spectrogram situation [think I get it now]: 
**** okay so it says that the spectrogram representation of speech is calculated from a model of the peripheral auditory system. 
**** What I'm missing here is how we do anything with the neural population activity. 
**** So... what I'm putting together is that we have the waveform of the speech. the real one. we put it thru this peripheral auditory system model and get the auditory spectrogram a la the pattern of activity on the auditory nerve. 
**** The LINEAR REGRESSION:
***** finds a linear mapping between the neuron population response to the stimulus representation. 
***** so then, this would have been trained on a bunch of pre-existing sentences and activity data. so this mapping would be established already.
***** so then for the test stimuli, we get the neural population data. then we do the linear mapping to the auditory spectrogram. then compare. 
***** and we GET the "real" auditory spectrogram of the test stimulus using the peripheral auditory model. okay. 
**** DNN:
***** So with the DNN, the reconstruction target is still this auditory spectrogram, which I do believe is still constructed (in the case of the "real" training ones) from the model of the peripheral auditory system, as described above. 
***** Except, instead of training the model on a linear regression, aka linear mapping from neural responses to the spectrogram --> 
***** Instead, we do a "nonlinear regression model" here with the DNN
***** Is there a training set here? 
***** So here what we do feels a little more straightforward, in the way they explained it at least, in the sense that we take the neural resonses, calculate a high-dim representation of these responses with an FCN.
***** These mid-level extracted features (*such as??*) are then input to the feature summation network (in this case, 2-layer FCN), to get a reconstruction of the auditory spectrogram. 
**** In both cases above, believe the auditory spectrogram is --> waveform via the iterative convex optimization algorithm mentioned previously. 
*** So now let me think again about the vocoder situation:
**** The reconstructed vocoder parameter estimates are --> waveform via the WORLD algorithm.  
**** neural responses -> compressed vocoder parameters --> AEC (?) --> decoding to uncompressed vocoder parameters --> WORLD --> waveform
**** linear regression:
***** from neural responses --> compressed vocoder parameters. 
***** guess we ... just do that?? linear mapping from neural responses to the various vocoder parameters? can see why that wouldn't do well. 
**** DNN:
***** So with the DNN, the reconstruction target is the 256 (compact) vocoder parameters. 
***** See Fig. 2D
***** so with this we take the neural responses, put them thru the feature extraction (FCN + LCN), then put that output as input to the feature summation (2-layer FCN), which results in reconstructed compressed vocoder parameters. 
***** Guessing there is training sets with respect to taking the real waveform, then optimizing the feature extraction/summation part in order to minimize the error between the ... what? the compressed vocoder parameters? yeah. believe so (see end of page 3)  --> and see end of page 9 (DNN training and cross validation) 
*** VOCODER: neural responses -> LINEAR OR DNN --> reconstructed compressed vocoder parameters --> AEC (?) --> decoding to uncompressed vocoder parameters --> WORLD --> waveform
*** SPECTROGRAM: neural responses --> LINEAR OR DNN --> auditory spectrogram --> iterative convex optimization algorithm --> waveform 
** Reconstructing Speech from Human Auditory Cortex, 2012:
*** Giving this a second read-through
*** "Comparison of the original and reconstructed stimulus representation provides a quantitative description of the specific features that can be encoded by the neural population. Furthermore, different stimulus representations, referred to as encoding models, can be directly compared to test hypotheses about how the neural population represents auditory function [16]."
*** After reading that above paper, I have a better intuitive feel for what this above sentence means. We work backwards from neural population activity to a certain stimulus representation. (A representation which is derived from the original waveform by some transformation. The relationship between the neural population activity and the reconstructed stimulus representation is some kind of (series of) operation(s).)
*** In THIS paper, they are not expecting a faithful reconstruction of the stimulus, since the hypothesis/assumption is that some amount of processing has occurred (pSTG, nonprimary auditory cortex). 
*** RECORDED DATA: "Cortical surface field potentials were recorded from non-penetrating multi-electrode arrays" --> LFP equivalent?
*** "...models take as input time-varying neural signals at multiple electrodes and output a spectrogram consisting of time-varying SPECTRAL POWER across a range of acoustic frequencies (180-7000 Hz)."
*** QUOTE: "The key component in the reconstruction algorithm is the choice of stimulus representation, as this choice encapsulates a hypothesis about the neural coding strategy under study."
*** QUESTION --> wonder if the number of electrodes is what matters, or the increased sampling area? or both --> is it a matter of sampling density, if you will? 
*** Think I understand fig 6B a little more -- the constant value there is a reflection of the constant modulation rate, if you will. 
*** QUESTIONS / THINGS TO UNDERSTAND:
**** need to still keep trying to understand spectral modulation 
**** citation 7: harmonics vs. formants. 
**** ^^ See also figure 6A. 
**** need to understand why this high gamma envelope matters, or what the deal is here... page 4. hm. 
* <2020-09-17 Thu -- spectral modulation>
** it's like the amplitude-modulated envelope of a continuously increasing frequency signal or something. 
** octave --> doubling in frequency (cycles/second of the carrier signal -- fine signal)
** spectral modulation depth --> amplitude (in dB) of the modulation sine wave. 
* <2020-09-18 Fri -- spectrotemporal modulation>
** THINK I MIGHT FINALLY KINDA GET IT --> see Fig 1b and text in "Multiresolution spectrotemporal analysis of complex sounds"
** To look at spectral modulation --> TILT YOUR HEAD ON THE SPECTROGRAM 90 DEGREES!!! LOOK AT THE FREQUENCY CHANGES!! 
** Look at the figs I collected earlier
*** flat ripple --> no temporal modulation
*** vertical ripple --> no spectral modulation 
** NOTE --> about the paper from the other day, on human speech reconstruction... the number 129 or 128 came up (maybe this is about the number of frequency bands in cochlea or at least in the cochlear simulator being used?) 
** POTENTIAL QUESTION --> 
*** Finally had a question that is genuinely interesting to me – not sure if it’s what I’ll end up pursuing, but at least I’m genuinely interested… to what extent does the STRF (spectrotemporal response field) of a given cell depend on the physiology, and to what extent does it depend on downstream processes in the network? 
*** Good question here because, well, we didn’t tune the cells to have any particular response, or to any particular tuning curve. If that emerges, it will be entirely because of the network (and of course because of whatever properties we baked in). 
* <2020-09-22 Tue -- STRFs>
** use model to look more carefully at STRFs 
** Perhaps use it to look at laminar transformation... contribution of certain circuits... hm. 
** Potentially use ripple stimuli first to see if any even get generated -- can compare to what things look like when using vocalizations, a la this paper: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507792/ ("Differences between Spectro-Temporal Receptive Fields Derived from Artificial and Natural Stimuli in the Auditory Cortex", 2012)

**** So then I realized it's because I have that readme in the github repo, so I did git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories, but then that led me to a screen where I clearly had to input a message, so I quit terminal. 
**** Re-opened terminal, did git status in the thesis directory on local machine, saw that I had to do commit in order to finish the merge, so I did git commit -m 'adding readme' (or something like that)
**** THEN, I was able, from terminal, in thesis dir, to be able to do git push origin master -- now both github and local machine have all the relevant files

** "Network-Level Control of Frequency Tuning in Auditory Cortex"
*** Authors: Hiroyuki K. Kato, Samuel K. Asinof, Jeffry S. Isaacson
*** Neuron 95, 412-423, 2017
*** METHODS: 2-photon calcium imaging, in vivo whole-cell recording 
*** ANIMAL MODEL: mouse 
*** MAIN FINDING: non-preferred tones suppress both E and I inputs to L2/3, and SST (aka SOM) interneurons are the ones responsible for the activity they describe (vs. PV) 
*** "The excitatory synaptic input driving tuned pyramidal cell activity comes from TWO MAIN SOURCES:.."
**** (1) Afferent thalamic inputs
**** (2) Recurrent synapses between pyramidal cells themselves (amplifies thalamic input) 
*** QUESTION: How to measure / define / investigate "tuning broadness"? 
**** It says here that lateral inhibition occurs when synaptic inhibition is more broadly tuned than excitation, which makes sense. 
**** Is it just a matter of recording responses to stimuli...? 
**** The citations at the end (right column, bottom) of page 412, and top left column of page 413 may help answer this specifically. 
*** Debate about role of lateral inhibition in A1:
**** Findings in previous studies have shown "perfectly balanced" E and I in L2/3 and L4, or I only slightly more broadly tuned than E. 
**** Confusing findings about two-tone suppression. Wonder if this is one of those things that's only confusing bc they were being evaluated in a too-simple way. If looked at from the perspective of STRF, for example, maybe better? Could see that, potentially. (i.e. The octaves below problem could actually be bc they're creating a sort of ripple stimulus by accident.)
*** "Iceberg Effect" ?? Ah, only the strongest E input pushes cell to threshold (only tip of iceberg above the water, I'm guessing is the metaphor here). 
*** Lateral Inhibition investigation methods:
**** Imaging was done in L2/3 (awake, head-fixed mice, in vivo)
**** td-tomato in GABAergic inhibitory neurons
**** GCaMP6s in ... presumably excitatory pyramidal L2/3 cells? (yes)
**** TRFs = Tonal Receptive Fields
*** "...lateral inhibition was clearly present, since pyramidal cells could have both excitatory and suppressive responses to non-overlapping frequencies (Figure 1B, bottom)." <-- hm. Not entirely sure I understand how we get from point A to point B here, but okay. 
*** "Rather, our results indicate that lateral inhibition biased toward frequencies higher than those driving excitation shapes frequency tuning in A1 of awake mice."
*** CFs (characteristic frequencies) for excitation showed tonotopic spread, while CFs for suppression did not. 
*** High frequencies are overrepresented in tone-evoked suppression (bottom graph in Fig 1E). 
*** Fig 2B black line --> really looks like H current in here, haha. 
*** ^^ About Fig 2B --> Is the tonic spiking during the non-preferred tone due to current input or something..? Or is this just baseline activity...? 
*** During the hyperpolarization evoked by non-preferred tones, they saw an INCREASE in CELL INPUT RESISTANCE (vs. the usual, which would be a LOWER MEMBRANE RESISTANCE, evidently. Maybe think about this a little more... so... opposite, then?). 
*** Are these graphs like, funky recording-side-dependent +/- graphs that I have to flip the sign on to make sense of, or what. Figure this out!! 
*** "...these results indicate that the membrane hyperpolarization underlying lateral inhibition in A1 is due to the withdrawal of excitatory synaptic input, which is likely driven indirectly by local interneurons."
*** ^^ QUESTION THOUGH: Don't we see suppression of IPSCs as well though...? Or ... hm. 
** *THINK ABOUT HOW TO MEASURE TRFs OR SIMILAR IN THE MODEL - SEEMS VERY DOABLE*
** *THINK ABOUT, IF THE ABOVE IS IMPLEMENTED, HOW TO FIRST, (1) SEE IF THIS DIFFERENCE IN CFexc vs CFsupp MANIFESTS IN THE MODEL, and (2) WHAT MECHANISMS UNDERLIE THIS --> SOM?

*** dirac pulse (labview, or matlab script?) 
*** area codes --< which brain region it's recording from, and stimulation rate,*** huge delay in cochlea vs. retina --> ppl think flash is equivalent high vs. low frequency delay --> not equivalent. 
*** low frequency regions actually inhibited by the click 
*** "we can't study low frequency regions" 
*** diff vs same in high vs low freq data vs model
** Notes from meeting w/ peter (more organized!): 
*** Summary: 
**** Look at spontaneous, click, and then speech. 
**** Spontaneous and click info will be uploaded somewhere (probably dropbox) by Peter by Weds next week (~10/14/20). 
**** Discuss more about center frequency tuning in the model. 
*** Center Frequency Tuning in silico: 
**** Discuss more amongst ourselves about the process and implications of center frequency tuning in model. 
**** Questions to address --> 
***** How to do this
***** What frequencies to choose (NOTE: Peter mentioned 16kHz as making sense for monkeys for high freq). 
***** Is there a way to have multiple frequency-tuned columns (e.g. one low, one high), disconnected, and then to potentially add in lateral inhibition to see if low-freq inhibition emerges? (We would expect that low-freq inhibition would not emerge in disconnected column setup without lateral inhibiton.)
***** What would this lateral inhibition look like in terms of the modeling? 
***** NOTE: Extant hypotheses out there about certain inhib cell types mediating this low-frequency inhibition (https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdfExtended/S0896-6273(17)30517-2)
*** Click stimulus info: 
**** 0.5ms square wave fed to a speaker w/ certain specs (peter can send specs)
**** Broadband noise burst
**** Can call it a "Dirac pulse"
**** Click stimulus should be in same .mat format as previous sound stimuli (with potential additional variables, but no changes to extant ones). 
**** Sounds like the click stimuli being used are occurring at two different rates (1 fast, in gamma range, and the other slower, in theta range -- could be important for speech tie-ins). 
*** Click data info:
**** Peter will upload dataset regarding click to dropbox, then we will grab it and he will delete it. (SAME for SPONTANEOUS data). 
**** There will be info on responses to click in different layers (this will most likely be in form of area codes that delineate which brain region is being recorded from -- will also be comments about stimulation rate, etc.). 
**** There is potentially cell-type specific data, but sounds like hasn't exactly been extracted, and may be a bit of a project. 
**** Sounds like there is data from multiple regions other than A1 (MGB, pulvinar? TRN or maybe this was just a modeling suggestion ("exotic")?) 
*** Thoughts on papers: 
**** Progression could be model itself (spontaneous data) --> click --> speech. 
**** Click paper --> aim for j neuro or j neuro phys
**** Speech paper --> aim for science 
*** Other thoughts / ideas: 
**** Difference between responses seen in A1 to high-frequency vs. low-frequency sounds (low-frequency regions typically inhibited by click stimulus). 
**** "We can't study low frequency regions" because of aforementioned inhibition. 
**** Could model be used to parse this difference? 
**** Only verified difference can be traced to cochlear delay for high vs. low-frequency info transmission. Peter is skeptical this is the only difference -- sounds like he suspects anatomical / circuitry differences upstream as well. 
**** Peter notes that "click" stimulus is often treated as equivalent to "flash" stimulus in visual cortex, but disagrees due to aforementioned difference in high vs. low components (unlike flash, where whole retina is activated simultaneously). 
** ^^ Posted the above in slack in #auditory channel
** Added a section to the above notes on my thesis logistics plans on bill's sugggestion:
*** ERICA LOGISTICAL PLANS:
**** Potential paper progression --> 1 paper on thal inteneuron; 1 on click; 1 on speech. 
**** Tie together for thesis. 
**** Think about timeline! 
** GCP continued:
*** okay where to go from here? 
*** what is the goal? 
*** Modify batch scripts appropriately: 
**** modified the gcp info so it's my email
**** modify the custom() function so it reflects the cfg params? 
*** Modifications to batch.py: 
**** added my info (as stated earlier) to def setRunCfg
**** added 'NGF1' to cellTypes in main code
**** ^^ tempted to also add TIM, TCM, etc.? (Ask salva if reasonable or necessary!) 
**** added trial 33970 params to initCfg
** Need to update v number of netParams.py --> v29!!! brought in salva's changes!!! This was also probably an issue!! Didn't have EILayerGain changes integrated into my netParams file!!! 
** gcloud storage: 
*** on the left --> STORAGE --> Create bucket
*** bucket name: ericaygriffith_a1batch 
*** run this command on gcp terminal that you're using: 
**** gsutil -m cp -r [local_path_in_cluster] gs://[bucket_path]
*** run this command on local machine:
**** gsutil -m cp -r gs://[bucket_path] [local_path]
** Try to run a sim on gcloud:
*** from A1 repo on gcp --> python3 batch.py --> no module named netpyne
*** bashrc missing --> pythonpath pretty much empty
*** (on gcp), salva says copy and modify /usr/local/site/.bashrc 
*** put this into my ~/.bashrc 
*** quit terminal and re-open gcp to see if this worked.

**** TO ADD --> Entrainment deficits and aberrant oscillatory activity have been observed in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (CITE) and ADHD (CITE). Elucidating the mechanisms underlying entrainment  
*** TEXT after some reworking:
**** Entrainment is the alignment of low-frequency cortical oscillation phase to the phase of incoming auditory stimuli. Mounting evidence suggests that this phenomenon plays an important role in information processing (e.g. phoneme extraction), prediction, and selective attention (CITE). Deficits in entrainment have been observed in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (CITE) and ADHD (CITE), though the cellular and network-level mechanisms underlying both normal and abnormal entrainment have not yet been fully elucidated.  // This project uses a dual in vivo and in silico approach to investigate cortical oscillations and entrainment in auditory speech processing. Experimental data, primarily from macaques, has been used to construct and refine a biologically realistic model of the auditory thalamocortical system. This model will be used to create testable cellular and network-level predictions about the mechanisms underlying entrainment; these hypotheses will then be examined in vivo using techniques such as pharmaceutical neuromodulation. 
*** TEXT after further reworking (fitted to poster, but needs citations):
**** Entrainment is the alignment of low-frequency cortical oscillation phase to the phase of incoming auditory stimuli. Mounting evidence suggests that this phenomenon plays an important role in information processing and selective attention (CITE). Deficits in entrainment have been observed in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (CITE) and ADHD (CITE), though the cellular and network-level mechanisms underlying both normal and abnormal entrainment are not fully understood.
**** FIGURE 
**** (Paragraph 2) This project uses a dual in vivo and in silico approach to investigate cortical oscillations and entrainment in auditory speech processing. Experimental data, primarily from macaques, has been used to construct and refine a biologically realistic model of the auditory thalamocortical system. This model will be used to generate testable cellular and network-level predictions about the mechanisms underlying entrainment; these hypotheses will then be examined in vivo using techniques such as neuromodulation.
** Psych-relevant text for conclusion:
*** Initial text: Model will be used to explore the mechanistic origins of the spatiotemporal neuronal oscillatory patterns observed in vivo, and to make predictions on the proposed roles of neuronal oscillations in auditory information processing -- predictions which will be tested via targeted deep brain electrical microstimulation and pharmacological manipulations. EDIT THIS-- add in psych tie-in
*** After some re-working:
**** Data (e.g. local field potential (LFP) data, voltage trace data) can be collected from the model, as demonstrated below. At this time, model construction has been completed, and the final stages of network optimization are underway. Preliminary network results show thalamic oscillations in response to speech data (see raster and selection of voltage traces), and also show a potential effect regarding the strength of inhibitory input from Inferior Colliculus (IC) to Medial Geniculate Body (MGB) and degree of observed thalamic rhythmicity in response to speech input. (Note that these results are preliminary, for testing and demonstration purposes only, as they have been derived from a beta version of the network.)
**** As network optimization concludes, we will be able to use the model to investigate a variety of circuit-based hypotheses in the auditory thalamocortical system (e.g. the role of thalamic core vs. matrix populations in mismatch negativity (CITE), thalamic matrix and L1 inhibitory connectivity in oscillatory phase reset, lateral inhibition circuitry underlying differential responses to high- vs. low-frequency sounds (CITE), etc.). 
**** As stated previously, we hope to use these investigations to generate testable predictions which can be tested in living systems, with the aim of elucidating the cellular- and network-level mechanisms underlying normal and abnormal entrainment in auditory cortex.

billl  11:28 AM
sure
11:28
the meetings are fun if /when they ever happen again -- on the NIH campus

ericaygriffith:speech_balloon:  11:29 AM
sg - I'm reading about this now (faq's, etc). any chance you could give me a rundown on what exactly this is and what I should do with this re: thal int paper?
11:29
sometime, doesn't have to be now. I may be able to figure it out by reading!

billl  11:29 AM
yeah sure ... it's kind of bureaucratic for my taste frankly
11:30
but idea is that modeling is/will become gradually more useful so will need to be regulated by FDA etc so needs standards of the kind that they use when eg building a bridge

ericaygriffith:speech_balloon:  11:30 AM
I see

billl  11:30 AM
so .... we fill in these forms and can put a para in the discussion talking about the "context of the model"

ericaygriffith:speech_balloon:  11:30 AM
I did skim thru that 10 rules paper

billl  11:30 AM
guess that's the big thing
11:31
yeah -- a paper written by committee
11:31
actually come to think of it i liked my paper better .... :slightly_smiling_face:   ... let me find that one

11:32
same group of people but i led the effort so got done more coherently imho

ericaygriffith:speech_balloon:  11:32 AM
great! I will look over this - thx for sending. and okay that all sounds reasonable re: building that into discussion. will keep that in mind :+1:

billl  11:33 AM
was just thinking about value added since as you pointed out the model wsa used before; guess we (you) have also made improvements ?

ericaygriffith:speech_balloon:  11:33 AM
at the very least we have used it in a larger thalamic context (and it's behaving well), so that could be something worth nothing as well potentially?

billl  11:34 AM
yeah all that is to the good
11:34
and we did have that whole paper before so would have been published if julius hadn't thrown a snitfit

*** [DONE] 1) send links / explanation to auditory channel

*** consider supplementing w/ elife article as well potentially: https://elifesciences.org/articles/53445
* <2020-10-15 Thu -- gcp + paper + JC>
** Stuff to work on today: 
*** Batch sims:
**** Make sure that me and salva are using the same versions of everything (same params, same netParams, etc.)
**** Try out some w/ speech inputs
**** Try out specific L2/3 stims to see lower layer activity
**** Try out that thing zaid was talking about, but probably just use scp
*** Check w/ PL re: data
*** Update CV
*** Read about mmn
*** thal int paper 
*** journal club 
** gsutil issues (resolved!!):
*** Try what zaid suggested:
**** "The problem seemed to be that gsutil will cache credentials which may not have the correct scopes. there is a directory in you home at ~/.gsutil on the VM.  Delete ~/.gsutil, and try to copy files via  gsutil. Let me know if this works."
**** first ssh into gcloud (login node)
**** now look for this dir in ~ --> see it when I do 'ls -a' (.gsutil)
**** look at it first:
***** $ cd .gsutil
***** $ ls
***** credstore2  credstore2.lock  gcecredcache  gcecredcache.lock  tracker-files
**** okay now delete it, as suggested (cd ~ ; rm -r .gsutil) 
**** now try gsutil again --> didn't work from login node
**** Tried controller node --> WORKED!!
*** Added the above notes on how I fixed this to gcp gdoc from salva
** batch sims:
*** resolving discrepancy between me and salva --> 
**** cfg.json files look very similar on gcp (no significant differences besides e.g. saving params for traces, etc.)
**** Comparing in github has not been so helpful because it’s showing me confusingly, things that are not up-to-date in terms of what I have in my branch, etc. Very confusing. 
**** Strategies:
***** I could try to merge and then abort if there are any conflicts? 	–> Is there anything of mine that I would rather preserve though…? 
***** I could also try to look at salvador’s code on gcp to compare, but that seems a little tougher. 
***** I could ask him and see what he thinks.  
*** OH --> these results are probably before I fixed/added the gain params in netParams.py
*** Pulled changes on gcp 
*** Submitted, finished submitted jobs instantly -- how to check again? 
*** hm, ran this again after pulling the updates that I made over the last week and I'm still not getting the same as what salvador got. 
*** talk to him about this!!  
** batch sim discrepancy:
*** merged salva's branch into mine, and appears that bkgWeightPops.json might be the culprit! 
*** Changes to be committed:

>>>>>>> salva
*** pull again on gcp and run 
* <2020-10-16 Fri -- gcp>
** Tested reproducibility 
*** on local machine, switched to salva's branch (git checkout salva)
*** made a new branch from there (git branch repro)
*** verified that this new branch had salva's code (saw his info for gcp in batch.py)
*** pushed this branch to remote (git push -u origin   --> believe -u does set-upstream or something similar? saw on stack overflow). 
*** made local changes such that initCfg had only one batch param and that the gain params were set to the params used in trial 33970
*** added, committed, pushed (git push origin repro)
*** on gcp, switched to repro branch (git checkout repro)
*** pulled changes (git pull)
*** made a test change to make sure git pull, etc. was working properly on gcp, and fixed a syntax error. worked fine. 
*** ran the sim (python3 batch.py)
*** transferred data over to eyg_data (rm -r ~/.gsutil  ; gsutil -m cp -r ~/A1/data/v29_trial33970_repro/ gs://eyg_data  -- this was all done on controller node)
*** looked at raster --> VERIFIED! don't know what discrepancy is, considering I merged salva's branch into mine yesterday and didn't find any conflicts that were substantial, but okay, setting aside mystery for now. 
** Now try L2/3 stim batch:
*** switch back to erica branch
*** from earlier slack exchange with salva: 
ericaygriffith  5:49 PM
if I wanted to send some inputs directly to pops in L2/3, I'm thinking I would set that up in cfg.NetStim? e.g.
cfg.addNetStim = 1
## LAYER 2
cfg.NetStim2 = {'pop': 'IT2',  'ynorm': [0,1], 'sec': 'soma', 'loc': 0.5, 'synMech': ['AMPA'], 'synMechWeightFactor': [1.0], 'start': 0, 'interval': 1000.0/60.0, 'noise': 0.0, 'number': 60.0,     'weight': 10.0, 'delay': 0}



5:50
something like this? am I on the right track?
5:51
relatedly, would I set cfg.addBkgConn to 0 so I can see effect of stims to L2/3 more clearly?

salvadord  5:54 PM
addNetStim - yeah, that should do it, but set it in batch.py as mentioned last friday -- there's probably examples in batch.py of doing this

5:55
bkgconn to 0 - that means won't be any activity in network except your input to IT2 ... could also try that, but without bkg, might not be enough to trigger other layers... interesting to try both (edited) 

ericaygriffith  5:55 PM
gotcha, ty salva!
*** Added to batch.py:
**** # NetStim input to L2/3 
**** initCfg['addNetStim'] = 1
**** initCfg['NetStim1'] = {'pop': 'IT2',  'ynorm': [0,1], 'sec': 'soma', 'loc': 0.5, 'synMech': ['AMPA'], 'synMechWeightFactor': [1.0], 'start': 0, 'interval': 1000.0/60.0, 'noise': 0.0, 'number': 60.0,     'weight': 10.0, 'delay': 0} 
**** --> # ynorm...? hm. 
**** #initCfg['addBkgConn'] = 0
*** ^^ Try the above first before figuring out how to do a batch. 
**** Change name (b.batchLabel = 'v29_IT2_stim0')
**** add/commit/push, pull on gcp, run using python3 batch.py
**** okay there was a difference, but since start at 0, hard to see
*** Try running grid:
**** b.batchLabel = 'v29_IT2stim_startGrid0'
**** in cfg.py, changed cfg.addNetStim to 1
**** in cfg.py, uncommented cfg.NetStim2
**** in batch.py, changed initCfg['NetStim1'] to ['NetStim2'], then commented this out anyway
**** in batch.py, to params, added params[('NetStim2', 'start')] = [0,500,1000]
**** add, commit, push, pull, run. 
** ITS4 investigation:
*** ITS4 right now is the only celltype that is running into depol block. I wonder if this is because salva did his bkg weights thing with the old ITS4...? wonder if there's a way to check this. hmm.
*** Should I ask him about this? 
*** What strategies could I use to test...? 
*** Can I turn off some kind of input to see if there's a way to 
*** Can I add some negative netstim to ITS4...? <-- try this, no harm! 
*** IN CFG.py:
**** changed start for NetStim2 to 1000 (for raster) 
**** 'interval' for NetStim2 was 1000/60 --> change this to 1000/10
**** 'weight' for NetStim2 was 10.0 --> change this in batch.py
**** 'number' for NetStim2 was 60.0, but changed this to 10.0 bc... is this number of stims...? not sure. 
**** in batch.py --> params[('NetStim2', 'weight')] = [15,20,25]
**** in batch.py --> b.batchLabel = 'v29_IT2stim_weightGrid0'
** TO DO: L2/3 stim strengthen, talk to salva about ITS4 issue 
** Out of curiosity --> add netstim to NGF1:
*** in cfg.py --> cfg.NetStim1 
*** changed 'start' to 1000
*** changed 'interval' from 16.666666666666668 to 1000/10
*** changed 'number' from 0.0 to 10.0 
*** changed 'weight' to 20.0 from 10.0
*** Turned off netstim to IT2 
*** in batch.py --> b.batchLabel --> v29_NGF1_stimTest
*** 0Hz from NGF1, hm. 
** NGF1 trial again:
*** b.batchLabel = v29_NGF1_stimTest1
*** This time I added the NetStim1 lines to initCfg in batch.py. 
*** nothing
** NGF1 trial grid:
*** b.batchLabel --> v29_NGF1_weightGrid
*** 'weight' for this in initCfg is 20.0
*** 'weight' in params --> params[('NetStim1', 'weight')] = [50,100,150]
*** okay ! it works --> but had to get the weight up to 150 before it worked. 
** okay so then try again with NetStim2 but make it much stronger. 
*** b.batchLabel --> v29_IT2_weightGrid1
*** initCfg has NetStim2 
*** params[('NetStim2', 'weight')] = [50,100,150]
* <2020-10-21 Wed -- L2/3 investigation>
** Changes from salva -- merge these in
*** Comparison on github shows differences in:
**** analysis/bkgWeights.py
**** optunaAnalysis.py
**** batch.py (small, just which 'b' is being run at the end)
**** cells/bkgWeightPops.json
**** cfg.py (saveDataInclude also has 'net') 
**** netParams.py (EI ynorm bug) 
**** and of course his nb 
*** Merged these changes in 
** Running batch sims:
*** First just run a single sim (as batch) in order to see how/if the changes affect anything:
**** Using trial 33970 params from last optuna run, even though changed, just to see
**** b.batchLabel = 'v29_33970_baseline' 
**** python3 batch.py 
**** MAY HAVE TO COMMENT OUT THE NETSTIM LINES IN CFG.PY 
** ON GCP BUCKET --> in eyg_data, put all the old runs, prior to the EILayerGain correction, into beforeEIcorrection directory. 
** New params from trial 13425:
*** b.batchLabel = 'v29_trial13425_baseline'
*** https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/salvadord_data2/A1/v29_batch3/trial_13425;tab=objects?project=ecas2-nsf1904444&prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=false
*** ^^ from salva. 
*** Added to initCfg in batch.py 
** Discrepancies:
*** the only possible place I can see them coming from is VIP... hm. maybe try subbing in his VIP cell, or vice versa. let's see. 
** Either way --> Try some L2/3 netstims now: 
*** 'v29_trial13425_IT2Stim'
*** Changed ynorm for IT2 to [0.05,0.08], and added in cfg.addNetStim=1 to both cfg.py and batch.py (initCfg), etc. 
* <2020-10-22 Thu -- L2/3 investigation>
** Wonder why last night's IT2 stims didn't work...? 
*** need higher weights or was it the change in ynorm? 
*** Check ynorm change 
*** checked this, and then also changed the weights, and still not working -- what's the deal? check cfg files 
** IT2 still having trouble with --> Checking NGF1 to make sure it's something with IT2 weight and not my batch submissions 
** ITS4 investigations:
* <2020-10-27 Tue -- notes from last ITS4 change>
** Changes occurred on friday -- summary: shortened Adend(s), kept bdend and soma the same, got rid of axon (morphing from ITP4 back to ITS4): 
*** NOTES: 
**** in repro branch –> 
**** mv ITS4_reduced_cellParams.json old_ITS4_reduced_cellParams.json
**** copied ITP4_reduced_cellParams.json and moved the copy (renamed) to ITS4_reduced_cellParams.json
*** LEAVING SOMA AS IS FOR NOW! (== same as ITP4) 
*** LEAVING BASAL DEND AS IS FOR NOW! (so now == same as ITP4) 
*** TAKING OUT AXON:

*** make sure batch.py is changed correctly (batch name, fIcurve function, cell pops in said function, etc.) 
*** python -i batch.py (after git pull on repro branch of course)
** scp over to local computer 
** Get fI curves:
*** on local machine
*** cd ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1/analysis
*** change folder name in batchAnalysis.py, make sure fIAnalysis(dataFolder, batchLabel, loadAll) is the one you want 
*** python -i batchAnalysis.py
** [FIXED] Confusing --> looks like ITS4 and ITP4 fI curves remain the same, but don't understand why. Could it be that the cell types are identical here, so somehow the same file is getting loaded in...? Changed cellType back to 'ITS4' as specified in the .json file for old_ITS4_reduced_cellParams.json, and will test this. 
** Change in soma 'diam' caused depol block 
** Try changing 'L' as well to see if this makes things better/worse

Deficits in entrainment have been observed in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia(4) and ADHD(3), 
 
Multiscale electrophysiology data(2) (e.g. local field potential data) were gathered from 
awake, nonhuman primate subjects at rest and during tasks. Subjects were presented with 
various auditory stimuli while undergoing simultaneous recordings from 
MGB and A1. These data were gathered at rest, on  presentation of click stimuli, and on 
presentation of speech. Oscillation events were then extracted from this data and 
classified by frequency band (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma, high gamma). 

Experimental data, primarily from macaques(2), has been used to construct and refine a biologically realistic model of the auditory thalamocortical system. 
 
These cortical cell populations were distributed across the 6 layers of A1 in a manner consistent with empirical data. 

 and the 2 modeled thalamic regions (MGB and TRN), with the pattern and density of distribution again informed by empirical data.

            ▪ TRN (reticular nucleus):
                • RE cells (inhibitory) 
 
DATA-DRIVEN CELL MODELS: 
Cells were distributed across layers 2-6, except neurogliaform cells which were 
also included in L1, as these have been identified as important targets of the 
thalamic matrix. 

This was done via either multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithm or via hand-tuning.

** Calculate E+I background weights such that each population exhibits low spontaneous firing rates (~1-4 Hz).
** Activate connectivity between cell populations and drive network with noisy  background input. 
** Optimize network-level synaptic gain parameters (e.g. EEGain, EIGain) such that all cell pops show ecologically valid firing rates similar to those seen at rest empirically.

Network optimization is being performed with algorithms such as Adaptive Stochastic Descent (ASD) and Optuna (a hyperparameter optimization framework). Application of these algorithms to this large-scale, biologically detailed network requires 1000s of parallel simulations on supercomputers. 

Synaptic weight gains (E->E, E->I, I->E, I->I) were part of the high-level network parameter set being tweaked for this optimization. 
 
Electrophysiology data was obtained from collaborators who recorded simultaneously from nonhuman primate primary auditory cortex (A1) and medial geniculate body (MGB). This data was used to help refine the model and to investigate the mechanisms and functions of the oscillatory patterns observed in this data set. 
 
Model is being refined using optimization algorithms (e.g. Optuna, Adaptive Stochastic Descent) and data analyses from in vivo multisite recordings.

We used evolutionary algorithms to tune 12 high-level network connectivity parameters (e.g. background input and synaptic weight gains) in order to generate experimentally-constrained firing rates in all 42 neuron populations. Each simulated second required ~15 minutes on 96 supercomputer cores. For the evolutionary optimization, we ran 100 simultaneous simulations (9,600 cores) for each generation.

DOWNSTREAM STRUCTURES / INPUT TO MODE: 
Auditory inputs were simulated using phenomenological models of the cochlear nerve and inferior colliculus (IC), both of which captured the main physiological transformations occurring in these structures. The output of the model IC was used to drive the TC populations. This allowed us to input any arbitrary sound to the model, including those presented to awake macaque monkeys during experiments.

MODEL DETAILS: 

We used evolutionary optimization to tune this thalamocortical network to reproduce experimentally-constrained firing rates for each of the 42 neural populations. We tuned 12 high-level connectivity parameters, including background input and synaptic weight gains, within biologically plausible ranges. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time evolutionary optimization was successfully used for large-scale biophysically-detailed network models. 

This ability to dovetail model and experimental data will allow us to  investigate the mechanisms underlying the oscillatory patterns observed in this in vivo data set. Our model’s mechanistic predictions will be tested using targeted deep brain electrical microstimulation and pharmacological manipulations.

The in silico branch of this work aimed to replicate the oscillatory patterns seen in vivo, and to manipulate the biologically-based parameters of the network model to generate predictions about the mechanisms underlying the cortical oscillations seen in this data set. 

The cell models used in this network were multicompartment, conductance-based models with multiple ion channels, with parameters (e.g. channel density) optimized to reproduce physiological responses. Simplified morphologies of 1-6 compartments were used, and dendritic lengths were sized to match macaque cortical dimensions. The electrophysiology of each cell type was fitted to macaque (if available) or rodent electrophysiology data. Passive parameters (e.g. leak channel conductance) were tuned to fit resting membrane potential (RMP) and other features of subthreshold traces, including steady state voltage and sag. Active parameters (e.g. fast Na+ channel density) were then tuned to fit features like firing rate curves and adaptation*. Connectivity between these populations was then instantiated based on presynaptic cell type, post-synaptic cell type, and layer location. This information was again derived from empirical macaque and rodent data. 
With the network constructed, network optimization could then take place. Background weights and high-level synaptic gain parameters (e.g. EEGain, EIGain, IEGain, IIGain) were tuned such that each cell population showed ecologically valid firing rates, similar to those seen at rest during in vivo multisite recordings. Optimization was performed using Optuna, a hyperparameter optimization framework, in a stepwise, layer-by-layer fashion (L4 → L2/3 → L5 → L6 → L1). Application of these algorithms to this large-scale network required 1000s of parallel simulations on supercomputers. 
The ability to give arbitrary sound input to the model was a key component in matching the model to data, and in generating predictions regarding mechanisms underlying network oscillations. 
Mechanistic predictions from the model will then be used to guide neuromodulatory experiments in vivo, to explore the validity of these predictions in a living system. 

    • “Lesion” thalamic matrix 
    • Lower connection strength between thalamic matrix and L1 
    • Lower connection strength between L1 interneurons and L2/3 pyramidal cells

--- IN VIVO 

The in vivo arm of this study gathered multiscale electrophysiology data (e.g. local field potential data) from awake, nonhuman primate subjects. Subjects were presented with various auditory stimuli while undergoing simultaneous recordings from MGB and A1. Recordings were gathered at rest, on presentation of click stimuli, and during presentation of speech stimuli. Oscillation events were then extracted from this data and classified by frequency band (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma, high gamma)*. These data illustrated what oscillatory activity was present at rest, and how these oscillations changed in response to stimuli [USED THIS LINE ALREADY]. 

-- PRELIMINARY RESULTS:
Data (e.g. voltage trace data, local field potential (LFP) data & corresponding CSD data) can be collected from the model. At this time, model construction has been completed, and the final stages of network optimization are underway. Preliminary network results show thalamic oscillations in response to speech data*, and an effect relating the strength of inhibitory input from Inferior Colliculus (IC) to Medial Geniculate Body (MGB) and the degree of observed thalamic rhythmicity in response to speech input.* 
As network optimization concludes, we will be able to use the model to investigate a variety of circuit-based hypotheses in the auditory thalamocortical system (e.g. thalamic core vs. matrix activity in mismatch negativity, thalamic matrix and L1 inhibition in oscillatory phase reset, lateral inhibition circuitry in differing cortical responses to high- vs. low-frequency sounds). These investigations will help us generate predictions which can be tested in vivo, using deep brain electrical microstimulation and pharmacological manipulations, with the aim of elucidating the cellular- and network-level mechanisms underlying cortical entrainment. Mention phase reset mechanism hypothesis if going with new summary.

With speech signals, the frequency range of these envelopes lies reliably in the 4-7 Hz range, even across languages. 

These waveforms are filtered by the cochlea into different critical frequency bands. Each of these filtered signals has an envelope, outlining the edge of the quasi-rhythmic waveform. With speech signals, the frequency range of these envelopes lies reliably in the 4-7 Hz range, even across languages. 

Speech waveforms in particular have an oscillatory, quasi-rhythmic quality. The cochlea filters these raw waveforms according to frequency, resulting in filtered signals whose envelopes retain this rhythmicity. The frequency of these envelopes lies reliably in the 4-7 Hz range, even across languages. It has been repeatedly observed that low-frequency oscillations in auditory cortex phase-lock to the envelopes of these filtered signals. Furthermore, this frequency range matches the rate at which syllables occur in continuous speech. These observations have led to a growing body of data showing that phase-locking between cortex and speech waveform is a crucial component to the parsing and comprehension of continuous speech, with disruptions in entrainment reliably leading to reduced speech intelligibility. However, despite the growing body of behavioral work investigating the functions and significance of entrainment, the cellular and network-level mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not fully understood. This project thus uses a dual in vivo and in silico approach to investigate the mechanisms underlying the low-frequency cortical oscillations and entrainment seen during auditory speech processing.

The in silico network model drew from the experimental data to construct and refine a biologically realistic simulation of the auditory thalamocortical system. This network model, instantiated using the NEURON simulator and the NetPyNE tool, contains 42 [CHECK THIS -- see salva comment above] neural populations, distributed across the 6 layers of A1 or the 2 modeled thalamic regions (MGB and TRN). Layer boundaries, neuronal densities and cell type distributions per layer were based on macaque and rodent thalamocortical data. 
^^ cut this paragraph or shorten it -- basically restating part of abstract above. 

Mounting evidence suggests that this phenomenon plays an important role in auditory information processing, while deficits in entrainment have been observed in pathologies such as schizophrenia and ADHD

Once these neuron models were fitted and distributed across the network model in a manner consistent with the available data, 

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time evolutionary optimization has been successfully used for large-scale biophysically-detailed network models. 

First, connectivity in the network was disabled, and noisy background stimulation was fed to each synapse in the unconnected network. Excitatory and inhibitory background weights were calculated such that each cell population exhibited low spontaneous firing rates (~1-4 Hz). Following this, network connectivity was again activated, and the network was again driven with noisy background input. From here, high-level synaptic gain parameters (e.g. EEGain, EIGain, IEGain, IIGain) were optimized such that each cell population showed ecologically valid firing rates, similar to those seen at rest in in vivo multisite recordings. 

Parameters were first optimized within L4 alone. Once this layer achieved valid firing rates in all cell populations, gain parameters in this layer were frozen, and L2/3 connections were added. This was followed by L5A, L5B, L6, and lastly L1. 

circuit-based hypotheses in the auditory thalamocortical system (e.g. the role of thalamic core vs. matrix populations in mismatch negativity (Lakatos et al., 2020)), of thalamic matrix and L1 inhibitory connectivity in oscillatory phase reset, and of lateral inhibition circuitry in differing cortical responses to high- vs. low-frequency sounds (Hiroyuki et al., 2017).

This data will also be useful for building and validating a biophysically detailed MODEL of the thalamocortical system. We can extract data about cortical layer depth, identity of different cell types, and connectivity in order to build the model. And we can also use things like experimental LFP/CSD data in order to validate the model. We can then use this model to generate predictions about the mechanism(s) underlying this entrainment phenomenon that we see, and we can then ping-pong these predictions back to the in vivo side of things where experiments with targeted neuromodulation can be used to test these predictions.
We have a robust collaboration with a group that is gathering experimental data on macaques. Their electrophysiology recordings will help us look at oscillatory activity in the cortex. To this end we have data like Current Source Density data in A1 of macaque monkeys, human EEG and ECoG data, single unit recordings -- data taken at rest & during tasks. These data will help us understand what oscillations are present at rest, how these oscillations change in response to stimuli, how the entrainment described earlier correlates with behavior and perception. These are the types of questions that this kind of data can examine. 

These data illustrated what oscillatory activity was present at rest, how these oscillations changed in response to stimuli, and how the entrainment described earlier correlates with behavior and perception

An excerpt that could be useful for papers later:
Entrainment is the alignment of low-frequency cortical oscillation phase to the phase of incoming auditory stimuli. Mounting evidence suggests that this phenomenon plays an important role in speech processing. Speech waveforms have an oscillatory, quasi-rhythmic quality. The cochlea filters these raw waveforms according to frequency, resulting in filtered signals whose envelopes retain this rhythmicity. The frequency of these envelopes lies reliably in the 4-7 Hz range, even across languages. It has been repeatedly observed that low-frequency oscillations in auditory cortex phase-lock to the envelopes of these filtered signals. Furthermore, this frequency range matches the rate at which syllables occur in continuous speech. These observations have led to a growing body of data showing that phase-locking between cortex and speech waveform is a crucial component to the parsing and comprehension of continuous speech, with disruptions in entrainment reliably leading to reduced speech intelligibility. However, despite the growing body of behavioral work investigating the functions and significance of entrainment, the cellular and network-level mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not fully understood. This project thus uses a dual in vivo and in silico approach to investigate the mechanisms underlying the low-frequency cortical oscillations and entrainment seen during auditory speech processing.

*** git push origin csd
* <2020-12-09 Wed -- csd>
** csd pull request passed all checks last night!
** Changes to csd.py:
*** Changing plotCSD() lines with the title of the plot such that "CSD with LFP overlay" only displays when LFP_overlay is True (if False --> "Current Source Density (CSD)" 
*** took out these lines (already commented out): 
  # if LFP_overlay is True:
  #   numplots=1
  # else:
  #   numplots=1   # SWITCHED, used to be above numplots = 2, and here
  # numplots = 1
*** deleted this comment next to fig = plt.figure() --> #plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8)) #<-- quite large; for multiple subplots 
** Changes to csd.py plotCSD():
*** change A1_layer_bounds to layer_bounds and make this an arg (dict)
*** took out these lines:
****     # add labels for each layer -- would have to be adjusted by hand if changing layer bounds
    # fig.text(0.922,0.855,'L1',color='black')
    # fig.text(0.92,0.825,'L2',color='black')
    # fig.text(0.92,0.68,'L3',color='black')
    # fig.text(0.92,0.5,'L4',color='black')
    # fig.text(0.92,0.44,'L5A',color='black')
    # fig.text(0.92,0.39,'L5B',color='black')
    # fig.text(0.92,0.29,'L6',color='black')
** Salva having issues w/:
*** [FIXED] 1) LFP_overlay and layer lines showing when testing on A1 
**** Changed if statements with the above args such that they say e.g. "if LFP_overlay" or "if not LFP_overlay" vs. "if LFP_overlay is True" -- that way can use either True/False or 1/0 for args. 
*** 2) Suggests that layer boundaries not be hardcoded! makes sense. 
** Want to test on A1:
*** changing cfg.py such that (a) cfg.scaleDensity = 0.075 #0.5 AND (b) cfg.duration = 0.5*1e3 #2.0*1e3
*** ^^ hopefully makes it easier to run on my local machine? try it. 
** csd changes pushed to csd branch of my netpyne fork --> layer lines and LFP overlay should now work with either T/F or with 1/0, and layer boundaries are no longer hardcoded. 
* <2020-12-10 Thu -- data>
** Next steps are to both keep working on the thal int paper and to work on comparing data to model
** Going to work on looking at data for now. 
*** Idea from sam: 
**** "may be interesting to compare presentation of clicks at different phases of background oscillation ... but can try that when have a good sense of how click propagates through the layers"
*** So, next thing would be to be able to look at the click data 
** Data files and scripts:
*** matlab script from peter
*** nhpdat.py script from sam
**** nhpdat.py --> in ~/Documents/MATLAB/macaque_A1/
**** nhpday.py also in ~/Desktop/neurosim_misc/csd_misc/csd_verification 
**** Also --> this replies in part on csd (from csd import *)
**** ^^ so which csd.py is this referring to? 
**** ^^ ~/Desktop/neurosim_misc/csd_misc has a lot of files that potentially have what I'm looking for here. 
*** .mat files --> on google drive, and also in select locations on local machine:
**** in ~/Documents/MATLAB/macaque_A1/
**** in ~/Desktop/neurosim_misc/csd_misc/csd_verification/data 
** Next steps:
*** Make a .m (or .py? probably .m) script that will extract only the files that are relevant to us:
**** do this by recording location
**** problem -- how to do this? I guess batch by batch? bc I can't put all the files on my machine because it's just too many. 
*** Figure out how to get LFP/CSD from this data 
**** nhpdat.py will have reliable ways to do this
**** what needs to be pre-processed in matlab, if anything? 
** Data processing:
* <2020-12-11 Fri -- click data>
** Get CSD/LFP of click data:
*** csd_verify.py --> works 
*** have this lock into csd.py in netpyne/netpyne/analysis somehow. 
** Click data example file:
*** in ~/Documents/MATLAB/macaque_A1/click/contproc/1-bu001002015@os_eye06_20.mat
*** ^^ also put this file in ~/Desktop/neurosim_misc/csd_misc/csd_verification/"".mat
*** ^^ put this as filename in csd_verify.py and see if it works. 
*** ^^ Deprecation warning:
**** "python -i csd_verify.py

FutureWarning: Using a non-tuple sequence for multidimensional
indexing is deprecated; use `arr[tuple(seq)]` instead of
`arr[seq]`. In the future this will be interpreted as an array index,
`arr[np.array(seq)]`, which will result either in an error or a
different result."
**** ^^ Believe this arises from downsample.py's function where newdata = decimate() <-- this is imported from scipy.signal, so guessing this is where that comes from. 
** Clarification from same on the avgERP lines:
*** (1) # set epoch params
swindowms = 0
ewindowms = 50
windowms = ewindowms - swindowms
*** ^^ swindowms is the start time relative to stimulus onset
*** ^^ ewindowms is time after stimulus onset 
*** so this code is looking at the entire length of the data, cutting out the parts where there IS a stimulus, and then averaging the responses that come afterwards
*** from sam:
**** "that function is actually cutting out data where there IS a stimulus occurring
**** since the idea is to get all the responses and then compare them
**** so first the bad periods are detected, then the remaining are used to get the average ERP."
*** (2) # clean bad LFP values and get CSD
sigmathresh=4
*** "i think sigmathresh is a threshold X standard dev to exclude noise"
*** trigtimes --> absolute value (in time -- check units) of when the stimuli actually occur
** Note on averaging: 
*** for spontaneous --> don't average ("for spontaneous data usually shouldn't average // otherwise everything gets 'blurred' out since onset/offset of different oscillations/events will be out of phase // but you could align to some internal signal.")
** so ^^ given what we now know about spontaneous data not being subjected to averaging, should I add this into the csd functions? 
*** ^^ i.e. when trialType = 'spont' (or 'click' or 'speech') ---> when it is 'spont' then don't average, and when trialType is 'click' or 'speech', then average. probably. 
** Thresh questions:
*** These lines in load.py:
def calPosThresh(dat, sigmathresh):
  #return dat.mean() + sigmathresh * dat.std() # this was originally commented out, reversing it to try (EYG)
  return 100

def calNegThresh(dat, sigmathresh):
  #return dat.mean() - sigmathresh * dat.std() # this was originally commented out, reversing it to try (EYG)
  return -100
*** When 'return 100' or 'return -100' are the lines that are in use (uncommented), then finds 0 bad epochs in a sample click data file, which seems like it's probably not correct? 
*** When the other lines are uncommented and in use (e.g. return dat.mean() - sigmathresh * dat.std()) --> then it does find bad epochs in the sample click file I'm using. 
*** Try the same test on a spontaneous file? --> makes my computer go haywire!! 
* <2020-12-14 Mon -- meetings all day>
** journal club, joe tutorial meeting, covid vaccine town hall, md/phd interviews
* <2020-12-15 Tue -- csd time series>
** looking at time series of csd in data
*** Sam says to narrow it down to time around the stimulus intervals
*** trigtimes (from load.loadfile) gives the array of stimulus trigger *indices* (not in sec or ms)
*** ^^ how to conver this into seconds? 
*** stimTimes = tt[trigtimes(i)] probably? 
**** stimTimes = []
**** for i in range(len(trigtimes)):
***** stimTimes.append(tt[trigtimes[i]])
** made a script:
*** located currently on local machine in ~/Desktop/neurosim_misc/csd_misc/csd_verification/csd_timeSeries.py --> I know I should relocate this. what should this function be a part of? 
*** ^^ This should be part of a larger script on csd data analysis 
** Making a script for A1/analysis called dataAnalysis.py --> this will contain the functions and code to generate figures / analyses from data files. 
*** What does peter say... --> he says to write the code like the functions are already written. what do you want this to look like? 
*** Do this later 
** Sent email to peter sam and noelle -- need .csv file to correspond channel numbers to layers 
* <2020-12-17 Thu -- back to csd>
** Need to be able to get average across trials
** Made another pull request in netpyne (#547):
*** Did this because a couple of the minor fixes / improvements (e.g. boolean issues and hardcoding of layer labels in plotCSD()) that salva made were committed/pushed after the other pull request was closed. Made a new one so these can be merged into netpyne development branch (steps below).

** What are all the functionalities that need to be done here then? 
*** [DONE] Need to be able to take a file as input 
*** [DONE] Need to be able to take this file and extract the CSD data (and other related params -- e.g. sampling rate, stimuli time indices, time array, LFP data, etc.) 
**** [DONE] requires load.loadfile()
***** [DONE -- see below] ^^ this requires both load.getCSD() AND rdmat.rdmat AND getTriggerTimes() 
***** [DONE] Bring rdmat.rdmat into A1/analysis/dataAnalysis.py:
****** imports: 
import sys
import os
import h5py
import numpy as np
#from csd import *
#from filter import downsample

from collections import OrderedDict
****** put df rdmat(fn,samprds=0) into dataAnalysis.py 
***** [DONE] Bring load.getCSD() into A1/analysis/dataAnalysis.py

******** [DONE] Requires bandpass() <-- IMPORTED 
******* [DONE] Put Vaknin() into dataAnalysis.py: 
***** [DONE] Bring load.getTriggerTimes() into dataAnalysis.py: 
****** [DONE] requires h5py

*** Now need to be able to what ... 
** NOTE: NEW CLONE OF REPO --
*** I messed up with all the stuff above (adding/pushing that data file), so deleted A1 from local machine:
**** cd ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM
**** rm -rf A1
*** ^^ but first I made a A1.zip copy in case there were any local figs etc that I wanted to keep track of. 
*** then I did git clone https://github.com/NathanKlineInstitute/A1.git
* <2020-12-18 Fri -- csd>
** Potential csd bug pointed out by salva? 
*** Peaks in color map csd seem to dominate the beginning of any window regardless of time range. 
*** Sam says could be bandpassing artifact? 
** Trying to fix: 
*** created a dir on my local machine desktop (~/Desktop/csd_test)
*** created a test_CSD.py script, added the .pkl file he is using
*** trying some fixes:
**** (1) First try: vaknin: 0 --> 
***** However, plotCSD() doesn't have arg vaknin, only getCSD() does!
***** by default getCSD() vaknin arg set to True --> try False 
***** ^^ only seems to "stretch out" the csd data 
**** (2) Next try: norm: 0 --> 
***** getCSD() has norm set to true, try False (vaknin back to True) 
***** didn't do much of anything
**** (3) Next try: LFP_overlay:0 & ymax = 24 in csd.py 
***** clearly just scrunched it up into 0-24, so, yeah. 
**** (4) Change if hlines from if hlines is True (to eliminate bool problem) --> NOT A FIX FOR THIS, JUST A FIX IN GENERAL, KEEP THIS
**** (5) Add CSD time series:
***** Start at this line: # go down grid and add LFP from each channel
#     for chan in range(nrow):
#       subaxs.append(plt.Subplot(fig,gs_inner[chan],frameon=False))
#       fig.add_subplot(subaxs[chan])
#       subaxs[chan].margins(0.0,0.01)
#       subaxs[chan].get_xaxis().set_visible(False)
#       subaxs[chan].get_yaxis().set_visible(False)
#       subaxs[chan].plot(X,LFP_data[:,chan],color=clr,linewidth=lw)

*****       ## ADD CSD DATA FOR TIMELINE AS WELL 
****** subaxs[chan].plot(X,CSD_data[:,chan],color='black')
** Trying no bandpass:
***   CSD_data_noBandpass = -np.diff(LFP_data,n=2,axis=ax)/spacing_mm**2
*** Yes --> seeing differences
** Sam suggests calculating entire CSD and then plotting only the relevant portions (vs. calculating CSD in chunks) -- this will help remove edge artifacts. Try this. 
** Changing CSD as above:
*** changes are being made to csd.py in  netpyne/analysis/analysis -- in 'csd' branch of ericaygriffith fork of netpyne development
*** getCSD() changes:
**** take out timeRange as an argument
***** removed from documentation under getCS()
****** timeRange : list [start, stop]  
        Time range to calculate CSD (ms). 
        ** MUST BE PROVIDED BY USER IF LFP_exists IS TRUE **

        ``None`` uses entire time range if data is from sim
****** This was originally in between 'dt' and spacing_um

**** changed indexing of CSD_data so that bandpassed & raw overlays could be properly sliced according to timeRange
*** sam says: looks like artifacts are removed!! I agree (waiting for salva -- he is teaching)
*** plotCSD change to overlay:
**** changing LFP_overlay arg to 'overlay' -- giving option to overlay CSD time series (raw or bandpassed), as well as LFP data. 
**** arg goes from LFP_overlay=True --> overlay=None
**** documentation for this arg:
***** ORIG:
      LFP_overlay : bool
        Option to include LFP data overlaid on CSD plot 
        **Default:** ``True`` 

***** AMENDED:
      LFP_overlay : str

        **Default:** ``None`` 

*** QUESTION --> would it be useful to return any of the time variables, but using the entire sim duration? Keep this in mind when fixing plotCSD(). Don't think so -- can just get full duration from sim.cfg.duration in plotCSD() if timeRange isn't specified! 
** NOTE FOR FUTURE: fix csd_data lines in condition 2 of getCSD() -- seem like they could be better named or something!
** Fixed and tested!

*** FOR THIS PULL REQUEST (#548):
*** Title of pull request:
CSD now calculates CSD from full LFP and plots according to timeRange
*** Description of pull request:
Changes were made to get rid of initial artifacts occurring at window beginnings when plotting CSD. Now getCSD() will calculate CSD from the entire LFP dataset (vs. slicing LFP according to timeRange and calculating CSD on that LFP subset). plotCSD() will then only plot the relevant parts of the CSD dataset according to timeRange. 

Additionally, plotCSD() arg LFP_overlay changed to overlay --> can now input 'CSD_raw', 'CSD_bandpassed', or 'LFP' (as strings) to this argument, which will then plot the raw (un-bandpassed) CSD time series, the bandpassed CSD time series, or the LFP time series respectively on top of the interpolated color map CSD plot. 
*** https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/netpyne/pull/548
*** ^^ Sent to salva (link) and he merged -- done! 
** Back to csd for data:
*** ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1/analysis/dataAnalysis.py
*** Doing this on 'repro' branch
*** What are all the types of plots we need this to be able to do? 
**** regular CSD color map plot (non-averaged) 
**** regular CSD color map plot (averaged):
***** averaged ERP with respect to each stimulus epoch 
**** CSD time series overlay 
***** whole time series overlay
***** averaged ERP time series overlay 
*** How to best organize all these? 
*** AVERAGING FUNCTION(S) 
**** [DONE] getAvgERP --> from load.py:
***** [DONE] requires ms2index (also from load.py) 
*** NEXT GOALS:
**** (1) [DONE] PLOT the interpolated CSD like you do for the sim data 
**** (2) [DONE] Add CSD time series overlay like you do for the sim data
**** (3) [DONE] Add LFP time series overlay like you do for the sim data
** A1/analysis/dataAnalysis.py now has functions to plot CSD, average CSD / ERP, overlays on both of those plots, etc. tested and works w/ spontaneous and click data files. 
** NEXT STEPS:
*** write matlab code to organize only the .mat files that apply to us 
*** put in average ERP code (calculating + plotting) into csd netpyne

** In NEUROSIM/A1/data/NHPdata --- only putting files in that correspond to relevant auditory files!!!
*** Transfer them from ~/Documents/MATLAB/macaque_A1/click/contproc/AuditoryFiles
* <2020-12-22 Tue -- csd>
** TO DO for CSD:
*** dataAnalysis.py:
**** [DONE] get all .mat files from the relevant data directory 
**** [DONE] iterate through them to get avgCSD and regular CSD for a certain time frame
**** [DONE] change the saving method 
*** [DONE] areas.m -- Add ability to sort by recording site (A1, MGB, or TRN!!) 
*** dataAnalysis.py -- Add ability to save into specific folders based on the above, or pre-sort? 
** [DONE] Sort by recording site:
*** MATLAB, areas.m
*** ~/Documents/MATLAB/macaque_A1/click/contproc --> Added 3 new subdirs (A1, MGB, TRN) 
** NOTE: change structure of how you save/sort these files --> either save from matlab to the A1 dir, or process directly from the matlab dir. 
** Adding to main code of dataAnalysis.py -- was doing this in separate matlab script for no good reason, so now have the pre-processing steps in the main code.
*** Testing! 
*** NOTE: Should definitely break these up further into functions/sections to make it more flexible -- e.g. what if only want to see A1 or MGB, etc. Make input as args possible somewhere in this architecture. 
*** Commenting out all the CSD processing code in the main code section -- only testing sorting ability: have a bunch of known A1 and MGB .mat files in ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1/data/NHPdata/click/contproc/ 
** Evolution of pre-processing code:
*** went from separate script in matlab
*** next to code in main code block of analysis/dataAnalysis.py
*** now currently have a preprocessing function called sortFiles(pathToData,regions) which can do all the code that was in the main block (besides delete or move the irrelevant files)
*** Took out the following code ^^: 
  ## PRE-PROCESSING
  # (1) Get list of all the .mat files in the original data directory 
  # origDataDir = '../data/NHPdata/click/contproc/'   #'/Users/ericagriffith/Documents/MATLAB/macaque_A1/click/contproc/'

  # origDataFiles = [f for f in os.listdir(origDataDir) if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(origDataDir,f))]
  # origDataFiles = [f for f in origDataFiles if '.mat' in f] # list of all the .mat data files to be processed 

  # # (2) Set up lists for A1, MGB, and TRN files
  # A1files = []
  # MGBfiles = []
  # TRNfiles = []

  # # (3) Iterate through all the files in origDataFiles and find out params.filedata.area and sort
  # for fn in origDataFiles:
  #   fullFN = origDataDir + fn
  #   fp = h5py.File(fullFN,'r')
  #   areaCode = int(fp['params']['filedata']['area'][0][0]) # 1 - A1   # 3 - MGB   # 7 - TRN
  #   if areaCode == 1:       # A1
  #     A1files.append(fn)
  #   elif areaCode == 3:     # MGB
  #     MGBfiles.append(fn)
  #   elif areaCode == 7:     # TRN
  #     TRNfiles.append(fn)

  # for file in A1files:
  #   origFilePath = origDataDir + file
  #   newFilePath = origDataDir + 'A1/' + file
  #   shutil.move(origFilePath, newFilePath)

  #   origFilePath = origDataDir + file
  #   newFilePath = origDataDir + 'MGB/' + file
  #   shutil.move(origFilePath, newFilePath)

  # for file in TRNfiles:
  #   origFilePath = origDataDir + file
  #   newFilePath = origDataDir + 'TRN/' + file
  #   shutil.move(origFilePath, newFilePath)
*** Took out the following code pt 2:
  # ## NOTE: Do this more automatically by supplying dict of all the recording areas? For later potentially. 
  # for region in regions:
  #   if region in numCodes: 
  #     if region is 1:
  #       DataFiles['A1'] = []
  #     elif region is 3:
  #       DataFiles['MGB'] = []
  #     elif region is 7:
  #       DataFiles['TRN'] = []
  #   elif region in nameCodes:
  #     DataFiles[region] = []
  #   else:
  #     print('No relevant .mat files') # CHANGE THIS MESSAGE? 

  # # (3) Iterate through all .mat files and sort by recording area 
  # for fn in origDataFiles:
  #   fullFN = pathToData + fn
  #   #print(fullFN)
  #   fp = h5py.File(fullFN,'r')
  #   areaCode = int(fp['params']['filedata']['area'][0][0]) # 1 - A1   # 3 - MGB   # 7 - TRN
  #   #print(areaCode)
  #   if areaCode == 1: # why doesn't 'is' work here...? 
  #     DataFiles['A1'].append(fn)
  #   elif areaCode == 3:
  #     DataFiles['MGB'].append(fn)
  #   elif areaCode == 7:
  #     DataFiles['TRN'].append(fn)
*** Made the sortFiles function more efficient! 
*** Fleshing out the dict with the recording regions so it can handle any of them: 
1 - A1
2 - belt
3 - MGB
4 - LGN
5 - Medial Pulvinar
6 - Pulvinar
7 - TRN
8 - Motor Ctx
9 - Striatum
33 - MGBv
10 - SC
11 – IP

*** TRY: re-including timeRange = [1000, 1200] just to test out this hypothesis.
*** TRY: just doing one of the A1 spontaneous files on its own.

**** ^^ not sure where this is getting printed, but some candidates would be one of the nhpdat.py functions? the only one that I see is that we're calling loadfile. when does loadfile print something like this? 
**** ^^ 3 functions that loadfile calls -- rdmat, getCSD, getMUA
***** rdmat only calls print for the 'resampling channel' lines -- don't think it's this 
***** getCSD is actually in a1dat/csd.py -- getCSD calls Vaknin and removemean
***** ^^ removemean actually does have a print line --> print(np.mean(x, axis=ax, keepdims=True))
***** getMUA is in a1dat/csd.py -- this doesn't have a print line

** Okay, so I see that it gets up to the "if dorun:" statement in load.py, on line 2395 --> dorun is set to False currently. So, looks like it took the raw data file and did getCSD and getMUA on it.

** CSD.shape --> (21, 3107221)
** dat.shape --> (21, 3107221)

** getflayers() & csv issue:
*** talked to noelle/sam/peter -- emails below
*** TO DO: ADD EMAILS 

** For now --> use old .csv just to keep going thru the code
*** Put a copy of an old .csv file (19may9_A1_ERP_Layers.csv) into ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1/data/NHPdata/spont/contproc/A1 
*** Change dbpath in load.py, line 2399 to reflect this new location! 
*** NOTE: of course, this is not a suitable .csv file (ERP, it's old, etc.) -- just for sake of example 
*** Changing line 2400 as well -- note that this actually is for ERP and is the same file as the one I am using (still old, etc.)
