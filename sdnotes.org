** Aim 1 
c.3.1.4 Computational modeling:  We will model flexible cortical oscillations that likely occur in the delta/theta ranges (1-9 Hz) and support auditory information representation, as well as more rigid default oscillations that likely occur at alpha (9-14 Hz) frequencies and higher. This will reveal specific network and cellular properties supporting distinct oscillatory dynamical profiles. For example, rigidity in the alpha oscillations may arise from the strong bidirectional interactions between cortex and thalamus197,198, making it difficult to perturb their properties. We will test this by altering the bidirectional connectivity between cortex and thalamus. We will also stimulate thalamic core/matrix in the model selectively and in combination with pairs of inputs with systematically varied inter-stimulus intervals. We predict that long interstimulus intervals greater than 100 ms will allow the circuitry to adjust its oscillation wavelength to match because sufficient numbers of cortical cells will have time to recover from initially strong stimulation associated with the first input. However, short interstimulus intervals (< 100 ms) will not allow the circuitry sufficient time to adjust its oscillation period, instead only allowing phase resets. This would prohibit the efficient tracking of stimulus structures at these higher rates.

** Aim 2
c.3.2.4 Computational modeling:  We will use our detailed thalamocortical model to investigate mechanisms of phase reset. The model consists of several thalamic nuclei (MGB, pulvinar), each of which contain core and matrix neurons, and thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). The auditory cortex model contains multiple neuron types (low-threshold and fast-spiking interneurons, pyramidal neurons, spiny stellate neurons) arranged in 6 cortical layers. Neurons are wired using GABAA/GABAB and AMPA/NMDA synapses with appropriate time constants and connection densities based on the literature150,213,214. Importantly, thalamic matrix neurons primarily project to the supragranular cortical layers while thalamic core neurons project to granular and infragranular layers. Our preliminary modeling suggests that thalamic matrix neurons target supragranular dendrite-targeting interneurons, allowing them to contribute to long-lasting inhibition critical for effective phase reset203. We will use our model to test basic mechanisms of phase reset, including the transition from tonic to burst firing, which could be modeled by adjusting the synaptic gain of thalamic matrix neurons. These manipulations would act as a correlate of changes in attention or pharmacological manipulation and will offer predictions on effective neuromodulation strategies for inducing/preventing phase reset through specific pharmacological manipulation of the matrix.


** Aim 3
c.3.3.4 Computational modeling: We will use our model of the thalamocortical system to investigate mechanisms of auditory stream segregation and parsing and their role in auditory information processing. As a correlate of auditory function, we will test auditory decoding fidelity using model LFP/CSD activity to recover auditory signals15  under conditions hypothesized to contribute to more or less effective stream segregation and parsing. We hypothesize that stream segregation and parsing occur through a process of dynamic competition between distinct neuronal ensembles that represent specific auditory information and those that do not, through dynamically regulated inhibition from MGB and pulvinar. To test mechanisms of stream segregation, we will present two competing streams to the MGB neurons with systematically varying gain levels. We predict that the recovered fidelity of the attended signal will depend on the amplitude ratios of stimulus streams and synaptic gains of MGB neurons. We will also test if tonic activation of pulvinar matrix enhances auditory stimulus parsing, enabling better auditory decoding by inserting strong inhibitory periods in A1 activity between repetitive patterns in sound clouds or words in speech218. We will test under which conditions hyperpolarizing pulvinar matrix neurons causes them to burst and reset phase. This reset would presumably activate supragranular interneurons and suppress cortical activation, creating a neural pause corresponding to auditory stimulus stream related activity, improving stimulus encoding/decoding. Depending on the auditory stimulus spectrotemporal characteristics, our model may not accurately encode auditory information. To compensate for this, model synapses will include inhibitory time constants over a broad range of values within physiological limits, enabling variable-pause durations. We will test whether this manipulation will enhance flexible decoding under attention.

* CELL TYPES
** Budinger et al 2018
- Budinger 2018 also mentions few stellates in A1 compared to V1 or S1 (in most species), and also few pyramidal
- large, intrinsically bursting, non adapting pyramidal cells (~PT) found in L5A and L5A/B border
- medium size pyramidals, regular spiking and adapting (~IT) found throughout L5A and 5B
- CT cells projecting to thalamus found in both L5 and L6
- (several differences compared to mouse M1)
** Excitatory types
- IT2,	ITP4 (pyramidal),	ITS4 (stellate),	IT5A,	IT5B,	PT5B,	IT6,	CT6
- maybe add star pyramidal: they are present in L3,L4,L6 and have different physiol, different axonal projs, more radial dends, shorter apical dends
- split IT2 and IT3 - since different connection
** Inhibitory types
- NGF1, PV2/3, PV4, PV5A, PV5B, PV6, SOM2/3,	SOM4,	SOM5A,	SOM5B,	VIPL2/3,	VIP4,	VIP5A,	VIP5B,	VIP6

** Discussion with Sam of I->E/I 
salvadord 9:55 AM
in the original M1 we had I->E/I as intralaminar, with distance-dep probability and fixed weight

for A1 I’ve improved several things:
1) I->E can target deeper layers as well (eg. L2/3 I -> L5 E) since synapsing at apical dends
2) VIP -> E set to very low prob
samn 9:59 AM
#1 very important
so now not all weights are fixed?
salvadord 10:00 AM
3) I -> I adapted probs based on cell type: VIP -> SOM (strong), PV (weak), VIP (very weak); SOM -> FS+VIP (strong); SOM (weak); FS -> FS (strong); SOM+VIP (weak); NGF -> I (medium) (Naka et al 2016;Tremblay, 2016; Sohn, 2016; Pi et al 2013)
samn 10:00 AM
thx, i like the level of detail in the interneuron circuitry...important too
salvadord 10:01 AM
for now weights are fixed but probs are different
samn 10:01 AM
sg
later on will want to vary the gabaa taus
(that's discussed in grant), but don't have to for first draft
salvadord 10:02 AM
note using the same interpretation of weight as in M1 model, ie. somatic PSP amplitude (mV) in response to single cell input
gabaa taus - sounds good … we can have a base model to start with and then improve iteratively
samn 10:03 AM
so that's good since constrained to the exptl lit
somatic PSP vs conductance change since more interested in effect at output?
salvadord 10:05 AM
harder to get conductance values, specially for dendrite syns
this is how implemented in Allen V1 model and Solstez CA1 too
samn 10:05 AM
ic
salvadord 10:06 AM
netpyne then has weightNormalization value that converts ‘weight’ (somatic PSP) to conductance required at each syn
(need to calculate previously for each cell type and store with cellParasm — weightNorm)
samn 10:06 AM
ic, and that's calculated via sim
in a preprocessing step
salvadord 10:07 AM
I have batch netpyne to calcualte for all M1 cell types … will need to adapt for A1 (in future should automate more)
